<h2 class="p4 p0a nobreak">I. ATHLETIC GAMES AMONG THE HOMERIC HEROES.</h2>

<p class="p1a small centre">BY EDWARD M. PLUMMER, OF BOSTON.</p>

<p class="tp">Few kinds of labor develop the body in a symmetrical manner.
This is true even in an elementary division of labor. The carpenter
and the blacksmith usually have strong, large shoulders and
arms, but small and weak legs. The farmer, from excessive bending
over his work, loses, in a greater or less degree, his elasticity
of body, and often becomes stoop-shouldered. If such defects
result from the more primitive forms of labor, it is not at all
strange that the laborers of the modern industrial world show
bodily peculiarities and variations that correspond, in a marked
degree, to their respective trades. A well-known teacher of gymnastics
in a New England college has declared himself able to
designate the various occupations of laborers in a Boston Labor
Day parade, without reference to any sign or banner, merely by
inspecting their carriage and physical peculiarities. It may, therefore,
be asserted that, while labor involving muscular exertion, if
performed in healthful surroundings, supplies the conditions essential
to good digestion and assimilation, to a more complete respiration,
and to the maintenance of healthy nerves, yet, only rarely, if
ever, does it tend to develop the ideal body.</p>

<p class="tp">Physical culture differs from labor. Labor, having the
design to produce a change in the world of matter outside the body, is
not deliberately modified to suit the requirements of perfect physical
development. Physical culture, on the other hand, if it really be
such, is a system of exercises that, taken together, bring all parts
and powers of the body into play, with the sole purpose of producing
not only a healthy, but also a symmetrical and graceful body; or, in
other words, of developing what the Greeks called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="eurythmia">εὐρυθμία</span>.</p>

<p class="tp">Of all the peoples, whose deeds have been recorded, the Greeks
alone made physical culture a matter of study. They did this not
so much because they considered it from the standpoint of philosophy
to be a duty to perfect the body, as because they clearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
discerned the advantages and prestige that accrued to the possessor
of a powerful and graceful body.</p>

<p class="tp">For the earliest account of this phase of Hellenic life one naturally
turns to the poems of Homer. Yet one must not presume that
these poems, simply because they are the earliest literary records of
the Greeks, exhibit this or any other feature of Hellenic civilization
in its initial state. The art of literature, mechanical on the one
hand and artistic on the other, though when its technique is once
learned, it becomes inseparable from civilization, and though now
we justly consider the nation that has nothing to transcribe
as uncivilized;&mdash;this art of literature is, nevertheless, only
one phase of the life of civilized man! If we reflect that even today
the lives of the majority of persons are, in most of their relations,
outside the sphere of literature, it becomes easy to conceive how a
people that has not yet mastered this art could, notwithstanding, be
versed in simpler arts that would fully entitle them to the epithet
civilized; and if we should find portrayed in the earliest literary
records of that people a very high and perfect social life, our conception
would be corroborated. We must not, therefore, regard the
Homeric poems as affording data concerning the origin and initial condition
of this phase of Hellenic life. On the contrary, the Homeric
athletics especially presuppose a long antecedent course of development.
Hellenic legend strengthens this inference. According to
a myth, Apollo enjoyed the diskos no less than music. He practiced
for amusement with his favorite Hyakinthos, whom, as it is
related, he <a name="TN004_1" id="TN004_1"></a>accidentally killed by
an unlucky throw. Other traditions inform us, that Orion challenged
Artemis to a contest with the diskos, and that Autolykos, son of
Hermes, instructed young Herakles in the art of wrestling.</p>

<p class="tp">It must be remembered, again, that Homer sang of the deeds of
a very select aristocracy, just as in later times, the French Troubadours
and Trouvères were to sing exclusively of the nobility and to
them. French literature remained aristocratic until the closing years
of the seventeenth century, when Molière made room on his stage for
the Parisian bourgeois. For Homer, even the noblest men were not
sufficient, and the gods themselves were made to act in his scenes.
There is, accordingly, some room for doubt as to whether the régime,
described in the Homeric poems, may be taken without modification,
as the régime of the Hellenic race at large at that time. It must
be remembered, too, that the poems were sung to the very class
whose deeds they portrayed, so that any additional splendor, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span>
which the scenes of this high life were adorned, would add to the
credit of the poet.</p>

<p class="tp">Let us, therefore, rightly appraise the Iliad, with reference to
our subject: “Athletic Games among the Homeric Heroes.” The
Homeric poems give us the idealistic picture of the lives of a band
of Greek nobles who, with their followers, had left their native
land, to besiege a foreign and hostile city.</p>

<p class="tp">Occasionally, however, we find the poet dropping a line
that throws light on the pleasures and employments of the less notable
classes. Such a side reference are the lines in the second book of the
Iliad, where the followers of Achilles, unable to engage in the martial
occupations of the rest of the army, because of Achilles’ estrangement
from Agamemnon, are described as contending in games. <i>Il.</i> ii,
773-775. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="laoi de para, rhêgmini thalassês diskoisin terponto kai aiganeêsin hientes, toxoisin th’">λαοὶ δὲ παρὰ, ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης δίσκοισιν τέρποντο καὶ αἰγανέῃσιν ἱέντες, τόξοισίν θ’</span>.</p>

<p class="tp">The word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="laos">λαός</span>, here
used, is usually considered as denoting the people or multitude. The
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="laos">λαός</span> before Troy, however, was
undoubtedly of the minor nobility, since at this time the servants of
the Greeks were, probably, the vanquished portions of other peoples.
And so the “folk” regaled themselves along the shore of the sea with
the diskos, spear-throwing, and archery. Of the three missiles, the
diskos alone was originally invented for athletic purposes. The spear,
in this case at least, was an implement of hunting, while the bow was
used both in the chase and in war.</p>

<p class="tp">The training of the Homeric youth and heroes in athletic sports
was, to a considerable extent, the result of the prestige of those
qualities required in war and in hunting. Athletics were a means
to an end, but they were also an end in themselves. Bodily
exercise was not an irksome task, but an agreeable pastime. The
ancient Hellenes were therefore a very happy people, the ends
that they sought to attain prescribed tasks that were congenial
with their national temperament. Accordingly, we find, in a well-established
condition, a system of athletic sports that were not
directly related to the feats of battle. Such a sport was diskos
throwing. The diskos was in shape a transverse section of a cylinder,
and in Homeric times was made of stone. The contestant who hurled
the diskos farthest from him was victor in the game. Doubtless
the advantageous positions and movements were well understood by
the skilled diskobolos.</p>

<p class="tp">That athletics were regarded as a mode of enjoyment, as well
as of military training, is shown by the fact that when for any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
reason the exercises of war were suspended, the heroes and their
followers resorted to games. It was hardly necessary for warriors
with years of experience, to train for the next day’s battle; they
exercised, because to do so was a congenial pleasure. Habitual
fighting will not alone explain this temperament. With the
Hellenes, bodily exercise was almost synonymous with life itself.
When they desired to escape from the chilling effect of a hero’s
death, they instituted games, and thereby reasserted life. Perhaps
the sufficient cause of this predilection for athletic exercise was the
climate of the Grecian peninsula. The clear, serene sky over
Hellas, the mild, bracing air which permitted nudity but did not
dispose to indolence, the picturesque country, girdled by the sea,
and presenting such a wonderful interchange of mountains and
valleys, smiling plains, and beautifully winding rivers, must necessarily
have aroused in the hearts of its people the desire for a free
life full of activity in the open air, and thus have contributed to
the formation of strong minds in vigorous bodies.</p>

<p class="tp">In order to understand Homeric athletics&mdash;the
substantial basis of all subsequent athletics&mdash;one must become
interested in the method and details of Greek warfare. For to the
Greek the road to distinction lay in the acquisition of the qualities
required of the successful warrior, and it was only natural that
pleasure and expediency should combine to make a pastime of the
feats of war. Victory in modern warfare is achieved largely by
the use of superior machines and by advantage of position. Until
the time of Alexander, victory among the Greeks, depended on the
muscular power, endurance, and skill of the individual warriors. The
central and principal feature of early Greek warfare was a personal
hand-to-hand grapple. Therefore, it was essential in preparing for
war that each separate soldier should be made as active and vigorous
as possible. That this mode of warfare prevailed until a late date,
may be seen from the fact that Plutarch attributed the victory
of the Thebans over the Spartans at the battle of Leuktra, <span class="allsmcap">B.&nbsp;C.</span>
371, to the superiority of the former in the art of wrestling.</p>

<p class="tp">Battle itself was an effective, even if a very perilous, mode of
physical culture. It often involved, to be sure, the death of the
weaker adversary, who was weak only comparatively, and who, considered
by himself, was usually an admirable specimen of man.
But, throughout all historic time, a branch of athletic sports has
existed that could not be practiced without risk, as fencing, boxing, or
wrestling. And it is certain that those who have survived the risks of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span>
these sports&mdash;the fittest&mdash;had developed bodies far superior in
agility, and attained far greater command over the muscular system,
as a whole, than would have been possible from practicing sports
that do not involve risk.</p>

<p class="tp">Chariots drawn by swift horses drew the combatants
quickly into each other’s presence. Hereupon, either from the chariot
or from the ground, they hurled at each other, their far-shadowing
spears (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="dolichoskia enchea">δολιχόσκια ἔγχεα</span>)
<i>Il.</i> iii, 346. If neither of the adversaries succumbed, both came
closer together, and with the same or other spears thrust at each other
again.</p>

<p class="tp">Failing to injure each other with spears, the adversaries resorted
to their swords or to any other available implement of offense.
Their object was to disable the opponent, rather than to conform to
conventions of war. Any mode of attack was fair in the Homeric
combat. In a battle between Hector and Telamonian Aias, the
two heroes, after using their spears, seize huge stones and hurl them
at each other (<i>Il.</i> vii, 264-270).</p>

<p class="tp">The weapons, employed by the Homeric heroes were as heavy as
could be handled skilfully, and of course varied in weight according
to the strength of the respective warriors. As the heavier weapons,
in the hands of a man who could use them, were more effective, it
was but natural that warriors should vie with one another in developing
the strength requisite for adopting them.</p>

<p class="tp">Their defensive armor consisted of the helmet, corselet,
girdle, <a name="TN007_2" id="TN007_2"></a>greaves and shield. The
Greek helmet was a close-fitting skull-cap, covering the head in front
above the eyes, and extending down in the back, to the nape of the neck
from ear to ear. Some forms show that the lower part was prolonged and
carried round so as to cover all above the shoulders. The corselet
consisted of two pieces, a breast-plate and a back-plate, which were
laced together by cords passed through eyelet holes made in the sides,
below the bottom of which the body was protected by metal girdle.
The <a name="TN007_3" id="TN007_3"></a>greaves, which were made of
flexible metal plates, fastened behind with buckles, covered the front
part of the legs from the ankles to just above the knees. The shield
consisted of a frame of bronze and several layers of tough
<a name="TN007_4" id="TN007_4"></a>oxhide, and reached from the neck
to the knee. The shield is described by Homer and is pictured on
<a name="TN007_1" id="TN007_1"></a>Mycenæan gems.</p>

<p class="tp">For the risks, exigencies, and regular feats of this kind of warfare,
the Homeric youth trained himself, and Homer makes it plain
that the attainment of brute strength alone was not sufficient.
Nestor is deemed happy because his sons were “wise-minded and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
mighty with the spear.” The poet frequently makes sly fun of
Telamonian Aias, who, although gigantic in size and of immense
strength, was, nevertheless, somewhat dull of intellect. To train the
senses, and above all the eye, to make the body alert and immediately
responsive to the perceptions, was considered quite as requisite
as to train the muscles. For, in the exigencies of battle, a certain
quickness of intellect was often more effective than brute strength.
Agility was, therefore, prized and cultivated above all other qualities.
When the ponderous spear of Menelaos smote and pierced
the shield of Paris the latter “swerved and escaped black death.”
(<i>Il.</i> iii, 392.) To fight successfully from the chariot, to dismount
and grapple with the adversary, necessitated not only muscular
strength, but also unabating alertness of mind, an ability to
seize instantly the advantageous opportunity, to dodge or fend
instantly the deadly thrust.</p>

<p class="tp">While agonistic sports were practiced in an especially
notable way on certain unique occasions, such as the death of a
hero, yet it should not be supposed that such contests were at all
uncommon. On the contrary, Homer is continually dropping epithets and
sentences that presuppose the utmost frequency and universality of
competitive games. Achilles is called fleet-footed (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="podarkês">ποδάρκης</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="podas ôkys">πόδας ὠκὺς</span>) <i>Il.</i>
ix, 307; Polydeukes, brother of Helen, is called the skilful boxer
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="pyx agathos">πὺξ ἀγαθός</span>) <i>Il.</i>
iii, 237. Indeed, such skill as Homer depicts as being shown at the
more notable gatherings, could not have been exhibited, had there not
been incessant practice and continual emulation. Again, Homer often
speaks of certain heroes as if their ability in certain lines of athletics
was well known, and had been often sustained against challengers. When
Achilles summons contestants for the boxing-match, he asks for the two
who are best (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="hôper aristô">ὥπερ ἀρίστω</span>),
<i>Il.</i> xxiii, 659, to come forward, as if it were well known who
the skilful boxers were. When Antilochos is mentioned as a competitor
in the foot-race, he is called the champion of foot-racers among the youth
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="ho gar aute neous posi pantas enika">ὁ γὰρ αὖτε νέους ποσὶ πάντας ἐνίκα</span>).
<i>Il.</i> xxiii, 756. Yet in this particular race, owing to the fact
that his competitors were older than he, he took last prize. Athletic
skill can be maintained only by dint of continuous practice. We may
conclude, therefore, that agonistic contests, by the time of which Homer
wrote, were of very frequent occurrence,&mdash;so frequent that they
were taken as a matter of course,&mdash;and that on special occasions,
such as the death of a hero, the arrival of a distinguished guest, or
the anniversary of some god’s benefaction,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
the games were conducted in a more public and ceremonious manner;
and that on such occasions prizes were offered and intense
excitement prevailed.</p>

<p class="tp">Funeral games were customary in Homeric times. Nestor, when
an old man, tells of competing in his youth in the various games
held in honor of Amarynkes at Buprasion; on which occasion,
Nestor was in his prime and was victor in the boxing-match, the
foot-race, and the spear-throwing contest; being surpassed only
in the chariot-races. Certain recorded myths sustain the scholar in
referring the origin of funeral games to a time much preceding the
age of the Homeric heroes. Pausanias speaks of the funeral games
in honor of Azan, son of Arkas, and the nymph Erato, as the most
ancient. Minos, according to Plutarch, celebrated a funeral contest
in honor of Androgeos.</p>

<p class="tp">In the Twenty-Third Iliad, Homer describes with considerable
minuteness the games held in honor of Patroklos, Achilles’ friend,
whom Hector slew in battle.</p>

<p class="tp">The chariot-race was ordained as the first event. This mode of
racing was not improvised before the walls of Troy. Hellenic
legend assigns the origin of the races far back of Homeric times,
in the dark heroic age of mythology. While the site of stately
Thebes was still covered with forests, Onchestos is said to have seen
in Poseidon’s grove, horses yoked to the chariot, and panting from
the race. When Apollo thought of building a temple for himself
at the sacred spring of the nymph, Telphoussa, she dissuaded
him, declaring that the god would be disturbed by the incessant
noise of chariots and the hoof-beats of horses, and that every one
would prefer to see the beautifully-built chariots and the swift-footed
horses, and so fail to appreciate the temple with its treasures.
Oinomaos is said to have offered to her suitors his daughter,
Hippodameia, as a prize for the victory in a chariot-race.</p>

<p class="tp">To the competitors in the race, Achilles offered five prizes,
and called for five contestants. Eumelos, Diomedes, Menelaos,
Antilochos, and Meriones sprang forward and yoked each a span of
swift horses to his war-chariot. The competitors were directed
to round a goal in the distance and return. Says Nestor, in advising
his son, Antilochos: “A fathom’s height above the ground
standeth a withered stump, whether of oak or pine; it decayeth
not in the rain, and two white stones, on either side thereof, are
fixed at the joining of the track, and all around it is smooth driving
ground. Whether it be a monument of some man dead long ago,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
or hath been made their goal in the race by ancient men, this
now is the mark fixed by fleet-footed goodly Achilles.” It is easy
to see that victory depended largely on the skill and cunning of
the charioteer in obtaining for himself the shortest course round
this goal. Indeed, Nestor, in advising his son, makes cunning
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="mêtis">μῆτις</span>) the principal factor of
victory: “By cunning hath charioteer the better of charioteer. For
whoso, trusting in his horses and car alone, wheeleth heedlessly and
wide at either end, his horses swerve on the course, and he keepeth
them not in hand. But whoso is of crafty mind, though he drive worse
horses, he ever keeping his eye upon the post turneth closely by it,
neither is unaware how far at first to force his horses by the oxhide
reins, but holdeth them safe in hand and watcheth the leader in the
race.”</p>

<p class="tp">On the other hand the Homeric heroes were well aware of the
advantage that lay in the possession of powerful and well-matched
horses. Admetos, son of Pheres, is said by Homer to have possessed
the best horses of those that were gathered before Troy;
they were very swift, and were classified and paired with regard to
speed, color, age, and stature; they were “matched to the measure
of a levelling-line across their backs.” <i>Il.</i> ii, 763-765.</p>

<p class="tp">Achilles, being the distributor of prizes and the chief mourner of
Patroklos, his beloved friend, did not contend in the chariot-race,
although his own skill and his horses, Xanthos and Balios&mdash;the
immortal steeds bestowed on Peleus by Poseidon&mdash;would undoubtedly
have won for him the victory. Through skill and cunning,
Antilochos quickly overtook Menelaos, left him behind and won
the race, although his horses were much inferior to those of the
latter.</p>

<p class="tp">It should be mentioned that in the race, as in hostile
combat, the Homeric hero made use of two horses. In the race he stood
alone in his chariot and managed his horses himself, but in the turmoil
of battle, he was accompanied by a comrade as driver
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="hêniochos">ἡνίοχος</span>). This was
beautifully illustrated by scenes on the Cypseline chest, a work
of art, which belonged, probably, to the seventh century
<span class="allsmcap">B.&nbsp;C.</span></p>

<p class="tp">After the chariot-race came the boxing-match. Achilles offered
two prizes to the antagonists, one to the winner and one to the
loser. He stipulated that the two contestants should be men of
first-class reputation. The well-known champion, Epeios, boldly
claimed the first prize, and in order to deter any one from contesting
this claim, gave voice to the following prediction: “I will
utterly bruise mine adversary’s flesh and break his bones; so let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
his friends abide together here to bear him forth when vanquished
by my hands.”</p>

<p class="tp">Euryalos alone dared to accept this challenge. The antagonists
cast about themselves girdles and wound about their hand strips of
raw oxhide. The struggle was violent, for “sweat flowed from all
their limbs.” But finally, Epeios smote the other on the cheek,
and Euryalos collapsed. “As when beneath the North wind’s
ripple a fish leapeth on a tangled-covered beach, and then the
black wave hideth it, so leapt up Euryalos at that blow.”</p>

<p class="tp">The wrestling-match was ordained as the next event. Again
Achilles offered two prizes, one for the winner and one for the
loser. Only Odysseus, the type of artfulness and trickery, and
Telamonian Aias, the representative of bodily size and brute force,
essayed to struggle. After they had girt themselves they went
into the midst of the ring. Here they stood locked in each other’s
arms, like two gable rafters joined by a builder. Their backs
were gripped with such force that they creaked; the sweat ran
down their bodies in streams; blood-colored welts appeared on
their sides and shoulders. Thus they struggled with the advantage
on neither side until the spectators began to grow weary. At
last when Aias had lifted Odysseus off his feet, the latter mindful
of his wiles, smote the former in the hollow of his knee, and Aias
fell backward, and Odysseus fell upon his chest. But victory was
not bought with one throw. So they rose again and locked. After
Odysseus had tried futilely to lift Aias from the ground the two fell
together in the dust. They rose and would have wrestled the
third time had not Achilles restrained them by declaring the contest
a draw.</p>

<p class="tp">From this detailed account it is evident that the Homeric athletes
practiced what has been styled the standing wrestling, as distinguished
from wrestling on the ground. In the former variety the
antagonists struggled until they fell, whereupon they rose and
struggled again. When an antagonist had been thrown three
times the contest was decided in favor of the other. In the latter
variety the contestants continued the struggle on the ground, after
they had fallen. At a later period standing wrestling was practiced
at all the great games. Plato, who was always alive to the
value of these contests, as a preparation for war, greatly preferred
standing wrestling, because it exercised the muscles of the upper
part of the body as those of the arms, sides, shoulders, and neck.
Wrestling insures not only health and strength, but also a fine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
carriage, and is an exercise well adapted to draw out all the
resources of the athlete. Plutarch then rightly calls wrestling the
most artistic and cunning of athletic exercises.</p>

<p class="tp">In heroic times, it should be noted that athletes did not wrestle
entirely naked. The oil which the Homeric heroes employed after
the bath and in anointing the dead, was never used in their gymnastic
exercises. The poet, who often minutely describes minor
and unimportant things, does not mention oil in this connection.
He certainly would not have passed over in complete silence, the
use of oil in these contests had he been familiar with the custom.</p>

<p class="tp">After the wrestling-match had been concluded, the foot-race was
ordained, and prizes for it were offered by Achilles. The competitors
were three,&mdash;Odysseus, Aias, son of Oileus, and Antilochos,
son of Nestor. Odysseus was the victor in the race.</p>

<p class="tp">That portion of the twenty-third book of the Iliad, that describes
the duel with spears, between Diomedes and Telamonian Aias, the
contest with the iron diskos, and the contest of archery, has been
pronounced, on good internal evidence, to be a late interpolation.
It should accordingly be considered as data for an account of the
athletics of later times.</p>

<p class="tp">The final contest at the funeral games for Patroklos was that of
javelin-throwing. When Agamemnon and Meriones rose to compete,
Achilles at once adjudged Agamemnon victor because of his
well-known excellence in this feat.</p>

<p class="tp">The scenes of the Iliad are too serious to allow the poet to dwell
upon the amusements of the common soldiery. Only at the close of
the poem, after a lull in the tumultuous succession of events, is a
thought given to sport. But even here, excepting the chariot race,
the descriptions are made with a certain careless brevity, as if the
poet would dispose of them as quickly as possible, and as if he
would say: “This is not my theme.” Achilles superintends the
games with a lofty indifference, and even cuts some of them short,
as if other things were on his mind.</p>

<p class="tp">In the Odyssey, on the other hand, the poet seems to evince a
greater inclination to linger over the scenes of sport, as being more
in harmony with his theme. A certain voluptuousness pervades
the Odyssey; the stern scenes of war, have vanished from the poet’s
imagination, and have been replaced by those of festivity and
pleasure. A new generation is described. Athletics have become
less violent and the scenes are embellished by the interspersion of
music, dancing, and poetry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p class="p0a tp">The poet, conscious of the change, portrays the new order of
things among the Phæacians, a people inhabiting a blissful island
on the western edge of the world. Hither he leads the ocean-tossed
Odysseus, the representative of the older generation. The
shipwrecked stranger does not ask in vain of King Alkinoös for an
escort that may guide him homeward. Says Alkinoös to Odysseus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Say from what city, from what regions tossed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And what inhabitants those regions boast?</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Like man intelligent they plow the tides,</div>

    <div class="verse indent25"><i>Odyssey</i>, Book viii.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">But the hospitable king will not allow him to depart until a royal
entertainment has been provided.</p>

<p class="tp">First a feast was spread at the royal palace for Odysseus and the
Phæacian nobles; the famous bard, Demodokos, sang tales of heroes
and of gods. Then Alkinoös bade the Phæacian young men prepare
for the games in order that they might exhibit to the stranger
their skill in manly sports. Thereupon, the festive throng issued
forth from the palace to the assembly-place, and the Phæacian
athletes exhibited themselves in the foot-race and at the wrestling
match, at leaping, throwing the diskos, and boxing. All of these
games, except leaping, are mentioned also in the Iliad.</p>

<p class="tp">Then the son of Alkinoös, complimenting Odysseus on his massive
body, invites him to show his athletic skill. “There is no
greater glory for a man in all his life than what he wins with his
own feet and hands,” says Laodamas.</p>

<p class="tp">At first Odysseus declines, but when stung by the taunt of Euryalos
he decides to show his skill. “He spoke, and, with his cloak
still on, he sprang and seized a diskos, larger than the rest and
thick, heavier by not a little than those which the Phæacians were
using for themselves. This with a twist he sent from his stout
hand. The stone hummed as it went. Past all the marks it flew,
swift speeding from his hands.”</p>

<p class="tp">Then Odysseus challenges the Phæacians to match his throw; and
he challenges any of the Phæacians, except his host, Laodamas, to
contend with him either in boxing, wrestling, or the foot-race,&mdash;it
matters not to him.</p>

<p class="tp">Odysseus claims for himself the honor of being an “all-round<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>”
athlete. “Not at all weak am I, in any games men practice. I
understand full well handling the polished bow. None except
Philoktetes excelled me with the bow at Troy, when we Achæans
tried the bow. I send the spear farther than other men an arrow.”</p>

<p class="tp">Then the benevolent Alkinoös endeavors to soften the
stern mood of the visitor. “We are not faultless boxers,” says the
king, “no, nor wrestlers; but in the foot-race we run swiftly, and in
our ships excel. Dear to us ever is the feast, the harp, the dance,
changes of clothes, warm baths, and bed. Come then, Phæacian dancers
the best among you make us sport, that so the stranger on returning
home may tell his friends how we surpass all other men in sailing,
running, in the dance and song.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"
class="fnanchor">[*]</a></p>

<p class="tp">The scene that follows is one of exquisite grace. Nine umpires
(the mention of whom shows how important athletics have become),
clear the ring for the dance: A page brings the “melodious
lyre,” Demodokos, the blind bard, steps into the centre of the ring,
and is surrounded by youthful men skilled in dancing. “They
struck the splendid dance-ground with their feet; Odysseus
watched their twinkling feet, and was astonished.”</p>

<p class="tp">No languid ease was the delight of the Homeric
aristocracy, but activity of the most virile type. And, although
Homer’s two epics grew into form long after the splendid Achæan
civilization of which he wrote existed only in legend, yet he
artfully excludes any references to contemporary facts. Only by
<a name="TN014_1" id="TN014_1"></a>subtle inferences can information
about the Dorian successors be extracted. For instance, although works
of art were very common in the Achæan days, yet Homer rarely describes
them and when he does so it is with astonishment and admiration. It is
therefore held that in this passage the poet has inadvertently made an
admission with regard to his own times,&mdash;times, which, in fact
were characterized by a paucity of works of art. Archæologists have
demonstrated, however, that the legends, of which the two Homeric
epics are the poetic form, and that attested the vanished Achæan
civilization, were in very many details faithful to the facts of the
Mycenæan age. There is every reason to believe that the Achæan nobility
practiced athletics as Homer represents them. But it must be said in
addition that the authors of the Iliad and the Odyssey do not speak as
if athletic sports were a spectacle unfamiliar to themselves. It is
recorded by Plutarch that Hesiod won a tripod, as prize, in the funeral
games in honor of Amphidamos.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II. THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN ANCIENT TIMES.</h2>

<p class="tp">In historic times the great national festivals were already established.
They had undoubtedly grown out of local athletic festivals of very
ancient origin. Of these Panhellenic festivals, that celebrated once in
every four years at Olympia in Elis was the oldest and the greatest.
The nationalization of this festival is assigned traditionally to the
year 776 <span class="allsmcap">B.&nbsp;C.</span> This date depends
on a list of Olympic victors, compiled in the last part of the fifth
century by the sophist Hippias of Elis, and handed down by Eusebios.
Modern historians are not unanimous in accepting the early part of this
register, and the minority have supported their charge of spuriousness
by adducing unharmonious facts. In itself the date 776 <span
class="allsmcap">B.&nbsp;C.</span> is not unreasonable. And when it
is considered how comparatively easy and common travel was in Hellas,
it is not rash to suppose that the festival, when once it had become
celebrated as a local affair was resorted to by travellers, if not as
participants, at least as spectators. Certain it is that the Olympic
festival was already a Panhellenic institution, when the other three
festivals were established early in the sixth century, and that to the
close of Greek history it continued the most glorious.</p>

<p class="tp">The Pythian games were celebrated on the Krissean Plain in
Phokis in honor of Apollo. These games were held for several
days in January in the third year of each Olympiad. The prize
was a wreath of laurel and a palm.</p>

<p class="tp">The Nemean games were held in the groves of Nemea, near
Kleonai in Argolis, in the winter and summer alternately of the
second and fourth years of each Olympiad. The prize was a
wreath of parsley.</p>

<p class="tp">The Isthmian games, instituted in honor of Poseidon, took place at
Corinth in the spring and summer alternately of the first and third
years of each Olympiad. This alternation was arranged to avoid interference
with the Olympian and Pythian festivals. The victor’s
prize at the Isthmia was a wreath of pine native to the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p class="tp">Beside the four national festivals, minor games of more frequent
recurrence existed all over Hellas. How eagerly the victor in a
local exhibition must have turned his eyes towards Nemea, the
Isthmus, Pytho, and perhaps even to Olympia may be imagined.
Each of the four great festivals had peculiar features of its own.
Thus, the Pythian games, probably next to the Olympian in importance,
were characterized by competitions in music and poetry in
addition to the athletic contests. The Isthmian games were distinguished
by the addition of boat-racing and swimming contests.</p>

<p class="tp">But all were essentially alike. All were designed as
glorifications of the strong and agile body. All were marked with
patriotism. All were embellished with the greatest products of Hellenic
art. All were held in honor of gods. And a fitting tribute and worship
they furnished, not the mumbled prayers of a sallow-visaged, stunted
race, but the exultant feats of proud, self-reliant men. All were
attended by the most studied and artistic pomp. The greatest lyric
poets of Hellas, Simonides and Pindar, for instance, celebrated the
victors. Of Pindar’s <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="epinikia">ἐπινίκια</span>
or “Odes of Victory,” we possess fourteen <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Olympionikai">Ὀλυμπιονῖκαι</span>
for winners in the Olympian games. Twelve <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Pythionikai">Πυθιονῖκαι</span>
for the Pythian games, seven <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Nemeonikai">Νεμεονῖκαι</span>
for the Nemean games, and eleven <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Isthmeonikai">Ἰσθμεονῖκαι</span>
for the Isthmian games. Even the wise men and famous bards of Greece
could not resist the desire to be present. It is said that the Spartan
Chilon, one of the seven wise men of Greece, died while witnessing
these games, being overcome with joy at his son’s victory. Sages like
Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, Sokrates, Plato, Aristippos, Diogenes and
Thales came, lured not only by the desire of beholding athletic feats,
but also eager to engage in debate, or perhaps to explain some new
theory of the universe. Statesmen like Themistokles and Kimon resorted
to the games and there met the rulers of distant states. Orators and
sophists like Gorgias, Lysias and Demosthenes, were present at the
Olympian games. The first two made great panegyric speeches. The games
on the Isthmus were attended by the great dramatists Aischylos and
Ion. Historians like Herodotos carried their scrolls to read before
assembled Hellas. Artists came to exhibit their works of art, and
perhaps to obtain new customers. Sculptors showed models of their
skill, and potters exhibited vases. These games, like the Schwingfest
and the shooting-matches of Switzerland, served not only as pleasant
occasions of reunion, but tended to the diffusion of national ideas. In
the language of John Fiske, “young men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span> of the noblest families and
from the farthest Greek colonies came to them, and wrestled and ran,
undraped, before countless multitudes of admiring spectators.”</p>

<p class="tp">The victor in the foot-race at Olympia was regarded as an honor
to his country, and gave his name to the current Olympiad, and
on reaching home entered his native city to the notes of a triumphal
song written by a Pindar or Simonides. Another significant
fact is that the Greek era began with the Olympic games; every
period of four years was called an Olympiad.</p>

<p class="tp">About twenty miles above the mouth of the Alpheios, in a long,
narrow valley surrounded by well-wooded hills, it is joined by
the ancient Kladeos, coming from the north. At the angle
formed by the junction of the two rivers is the area known as Olympia,
the scene of the greatest athletic festival that the world has
ever witnessed.</p>

<p class="tp">To the north of this plain was a range of rocky hills, the nearest
of which was the famous Kronion, conical in shape and about 400
feet in height. As its name signifies, this hill was sacred to Kronos,
the father of Zeus. Another low range bounded the valley on the
south. The western boundary was the Kladeos. Eastward was
the hill of Pisa, and further in the distance were visible the snow-crowned
summits of Erymanthos and Kyllene.</p>

<p class="tp">During the long centuries that succeeded the extinction of Greek
civilization, the precinct of the games, and the equipments, buildings
and statues that remained, were gradually covered by a stratum
of alluvium from the Alpheios, mixed with a deposit of clay from
Kronion. The rest of the world was not interested enough to record
the process, and when in modern times scholars saw no trace
of the original scene, it was supposed that the Alpheios by its overflowings
had destroyed all monuments. Recent excavations, however,
have revealed a very precious remnant at the bottom of the
alluvium. It was indeed not really a misfortune that during periods
when the products of old civilizations were treated with fanaticism
on the one hand, and rapacity on the other, the Olympian scene
was covered with earth rather than left exposed to the hand of
Middle Age barbarians.</p>

<p class="tp">The systematic excavation of Olympia was undertaken in 1875
by the German government. The work involved great expense,
and the willingness of the Germans to undertake and execute the
task has brought them much praise from the scholars of other
countries. The excavations were completed on the 20th of March,
1881.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p class="tp">During these six years a space in the form of a square, measuring
1,000 feet on each side, was stripped of the accumulated deposit
of twelve centuries; the average depth of this covering was
estimated to be over sixteen feet.</p>

<p class="tp">Archæologically, this excavation involved expert care and much
labor. Neither the care nor the labor was withheld. The result
may best be described in the language of an eminent professor of
classical archæology:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tp">“The result of these excavations, carried on there at great cost
and with supreme disinterestedness by the German people, has been
to enable the traveller at Olympia not only to study the scene of the
greatest of Greek athletic festivals, but to trace the celebration
from hour to hour and from point to point. He not only sees the
hill of Cronion, where the spectators crowded, wades through Olympic
dust, and feels the sun of Olympia beat on his head, but he can
wander on the threshold of the temple of Zeus, pass from building
to building in the sacred enclosure of the Altis, and stand at the
starting-point of the runners in the Stadium. Taking the guidebook
of the old Greek traveller <a name="TN018_1" id="TN018_1"></a>Pausanias
in our hand, we can follow in his steps, and out of broken pillars,
truncated pedestals and the foundations of demolished buildings, we
can conjure forth the beautiful Olympia of old, with its glorious
temples, its rows of altars, its statues of gods and godlike men who
conquered in the games, its treasuries full of the noblest works of art
and the richest spoils of war. And we can people the solitude with the
combatants and with the spectators, a crowd filled with the enthusiasm
of the place and with delight in manly contests; a crowd over whom
emotions swept as rapidly as chariots through the hippodrome, and who
were ever breaking out into wild cries of delight, or loud shouts of
scorn and derision. We can see the bestowal of the crowns of wild
olive, and can hear the heralds recite the names of those who have been
victorious.”</p>

<p class="tp">Here, then, in the summer time was held the great athletic festival
in honor of Olympian Zeus. At the beginning of authentic
history it was already a venerable institution. We have already
learned that early in the sixth century the other three Panhellenic
festivals were modeled upon it. Many myths very early sprang
into existence to explain its origin. Pindar, it is well known, in
one of his Olympian odes makes the Dorian Herakles the founder.
Of course, the myths do not agree, and if they did would establish
nothing directly; indirectly, however, they show that at the time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>
of their first promulgation the festival had attained so approved a
system, so wide a celebrity, and so great a prestige as to need accounting
for and to be compatible with an exalted origin. And as
a matter of fact, system, celebrity and prestige do not fall to the lot
of an institution in the period of a single generation.</p>

<p class="tp">The festival was from the first under the charge of the Eleians.
But so liberal a policy did this nation adopt and pursue that people
from neighboring states were glad to send competitors. Rapidly
the custom of resorting to the games spread to more distant states.
From an Eleian event, the festival became Peloponnesian, and
finally Panhellenic. The Athenians and Thebans at a very early
date achieved splendid victories in these games. The Theban
Pagondas was crowned victor in the four-horse chariot race in the
25th Olympiad, when for the first time this was a feature of the
festival. Thus one state after another turned its attention to the
venerable celebration, and if it happened that a citizen of one state
was crowned victor in a contest, interest in the games was sure to
be increased in that locality.</p>

<p class="tp">Even in the absence of positive evidence it would
be contrary to reason to suppose that the games were originally
established as they existed at the time of Pindar. In fact,
the different features were added successively. According to a
fairly reliable tradition, there was originally and for twelve
following Olympiads only one contest: the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="dromos">δρόμος</span>,
a foot-race consisting of a single lap of a stadion of two hundred
yards. About 720 <span class="allsmcap">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, according
to the tradition, was added the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="diaulos">δίαυλος</span>,
a race in which the stadion was traversed twice. Soon afterward was added
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="dolichos">δόλιχος</span>, or long race,
consisting of seven, then of twelve and perhaps twenty-four laps.
The next contest to be introduced was the wrestling-match. In the
same year that wrestling was introduced, about the 18th Olympiad, the
pentathlon made its appearance. This feature, though consisting of five
contests&mdash;leaping, spear-throwing, diskos-pitching, running and
wrestling&mdash;was nevertheless a single event, inasmuch as victory in
one contest alone was not rewarded; an athlete to be crowned victor in
the pentathlon must win at least three of the contests. Boxing and the
chariot race are said to have been added in the 23d Olympiad. Thus the
games grew more elaborate, and the time over which they extended was
increased from a single day to five or six.</p>

<p class="tp">The festival was conducted by judges, called Hellanodikai, elected
by the people of Elis a year beforehand. The number of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span>
judges was about ten; they were expected to give close attention to
their duties. Thirty days before the festival, candidates for the
various contests presented themselves before the Hellanodikai for
examination. In order that the name of a candidate could be considered,
he must prove himself to be of pure Hellenic stock, and
must give evidence of having practised in a gymnasium for ten
months previously; finally, the candidate must practise for thirty
days in the great gymnasium of Elis, under the supervision of the
Hellanodikai. The names of those who were able to satisfy the
judges were placed on a white board which was exposed to view at
Olympia. After an athlete had been entered for a contest, it was
considered the greatest ignominy for him to withdraw for any reason;
indeed, for so doing he was heavily fined. Theagenes, an
athlete of wide fame, was unable to enter the pankration because he
had been disabled in the boxing-match; but inasmuch as he had
had his name entered for both events, he was fined.</p>

<p class="tp">Eleven days before the festival, the Hellanodikai caused to be
proclaimed by heralds throughout all the cities of Hellas the truce,
sacred to Olympian Zeus, which was to last a month. It was this
truce that made the Olympia possible as a Panhellenic institution.
During the month that followed the proclamations of the heralds,
all wars between Hellenic states were held in abeyance, and travellers
were allowed to journey through them unmolested. The
awful name of Zeus coupled with the decrees of rulers made this
truce effective.</p>

<p class="tp">During the eleven days pilgrims from all over Hellas were approaching
Olympia. Some of the scenes may be imagined. In the
language of Professor Percy Gardner: “From all the shores of the
Mediterranean and the Euxine seas the Greek colonies sent deputations
to represent them at the games, to bear offerings to the temple,
and to perform sacrifices on their behalf. And the Greeks
readily took a tinge from the land wherein they dwelt. There were
dwellers on the northern shore of the Black Sea, to whom continual
intercourse and frequent intermarriage with their Scythian neighbors
gave almost the aspect of nomads; and colonists from Massilia,
who in dress and blood were half Gauls. There were people from
Cyrene, with the hot blood and dark complexions of Africa, and
oriental Ionians, with trailing robes and effeminate airs. There
were rude pirates from Acarnania, and delicate sensualists from
Cyprus.”</p>

<p class="tp">To give a detailed account of the competitions at each of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span>
great festivals would involve much unnecessary repetition. That
held at Olympia, therefore, may be taken as the type and the ideal
of the others. But even at Olympia, the celebrations of which
have been most widely written of both by ancient and modern
scholars, it is not always easy to determine the exact order of the
various contests.</p>

<p class="tp">There is hardly a doubt that at the Olympic festival as
well as at the others the foot-races were the initial competitions.
Plato says that at his time when a contest took place the herald first
called on the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="stadiodromos">σταδιοδρόμος</span>
to do his part. The reason for beginning with the foot-race was
probably an historical one; as has been said, it was originally the
sole competition at the Olympic celebration. According to the old
Eleian priest legends, the Idaian Herakles, one of the Cretan Kouretes,
came to Elis in the reign of Kronos, in the golden age, and arranged a
foot-race in which the victor was crowned with wild olive. The legends
further state that the place thus honored by the priest of Olympian
Zeus was afterward called Olympia, and that in time the celebration
was repeated at intervals of four years. Of course the foregoing is a
tale invented to explain the priority of the foot-race as well as the
founding of the festival. Another legend recounts that at one of these
subsequent celebrations Endymion, son of Æthlios, offered the kingdom
of Klymenos, whom he had conquered, as a prize to that one of his sons
who should be first in the foot-race. Such are some of the myths that
helped to sanction and endear an inviolable Olympic custom. It is
noteworthy in this connection that in the Odyssey the Phæacians had
opened their games with the foot-race.</p>

<p class="tp">The technique of foot-racing, the style of running most advantageous,
and the training and qualities necessary for it, differ considerably
with the distance covered. Accordingly very early in the
history of the Olympic festival races of varying length were one by
one introduced, and the variety doubtless tended to attract a larger
number of competitors and to make the occasion more interesting.</p>

<p class="tp">For thirteen Olympiads, however, the race called
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="dromos">δρόμος</span> was the only
feature. In this race the stadion was traversed but once. As the
course of the stadion was about 200 yards, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="dromos">δρόμος</span>
was what we call a sprint, and required that a runner exert himself to
the utmost from start to finish. This simple race remained a favorite
mode of competition among the Greeks until a late time&mdash;being
practised by Alexander.</p>

<p class="tp">The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="diaulos">δίαυλος</span>, or
double course of the stadion, was introduced in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
the 14th Olympiad. This race required that the runner, after having
traversed the 200 yards and reached the goal, should return to
the point of starting. As he rounded the goal he described an arc,
and on his way back took the opposite side of the track in order
that he might not collide with other runners.</p>

<p class="tp">Very soon after the introduction of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="diaulos">δίαυλος</span>
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="hippios dromos">ἵππιος δρόμος</span> and
then the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="dolichos">δόλιχος</span> were instituted.
The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="hippios dromos">ἵππιος δρόμος</span>, which
implies a horse-race, was in reality a foot-race, the contestant running the
distance generally covered in a horse-race&mdash;namely, four times the
length of the stadion, or 800 yards.</p>

<p class="tp">The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="dolichos">δόλιχος</span>
was added to the Olympic games in the 15th Olympiad, and was,
like our long runs, a test primarily of endurance and lung-power.
The distance covered varied from seven to twenty-four laps of the
stadion, or from less than a mile to about three miles. At Olympia,
however, the distance was twelve stadia. As the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="dolichos">δόλιχος</span>
was run on the same track on which the single and double races took
place, it was really only a series of double races.</p>

<p class="tp">In the 65th Olympiad, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="hoplitôn dromos">ὁπλίτων δρόμος</span>
was introduced. In this race the competitors wore helmets and greaves,
and carried shields on their left arms. <a name="TN022_1" id="TN022_1"></a>Pausanias
claims to have seen the statue of Demaratos equipped with a round
shield, helmet and antique greaves. At a later period, however,
the helmet and greaves were discarded at Olympia, and the race was
run with shields alone. The distance covered in this race was two
stadia&mdash;the length of the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="diaulos">δίαυλος</span>. Pindar,
the poet laureate of the Olympians, mentions the race with shields,
and with poetic privilege ascribes its origin to heroic times. Plato
considered the exercise very valuable as war training, and prescribed
it as a part of the athletics of his ideal commonwealth. Plato devised
two other races involving armor: in one the competitor should be
equipped as a heavy-armed hoplite, and should cover a distance of sixty
stadia on a level plain; in the other the competitor should wear the
light equipments of an archer, and should cover one hundred stadia over
hills and valleys.</p>

<p class="tp">The running contests at the great games were governed by certain
established rules. No fraud or guile was allowed to be used
by the contestant on the track for the purpose of impeding his companions.
They were very particular that all should start at the
same time and from the same line, so that no one might have the
advantage over the others. It was also contrary to rule for an athlete
voluntarily to slacken his speed and allow his fellow-contestants
to win. The competitors were appointed by lot and arranged in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
groups. These groups raced in heats of four, ranged in the places
assigned them by lot. The first group was followed by the second, the
second by the third, etc. When all groups had finished, the victors of
each again entered the contest and strove for the prize; so that every
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="stadiodromos">σταδιοδρόμος</span> had to win
twice before he was crowned victor.</p>

<p class="tp">The physicians of olden times mentioned two other foot-races
which in their opinion afforded excellent gymnastic exercise. The
first of these was practised in the sixth division of the stadion and
consisted of running first forward and then backward. In this race
the body was not turned once, but the distance that was run forward
was continually shortened by backward running until the
contestant finally stood at the starting-point. In the second race
the contestant ran on tiptoe with outstretched arms which he swung
violently to and fro. It was practised along a wall so that, should
the balance be lost, the runner could hold and support himself
against it.</p>

<p class="tp">Among the less important foot-races were two that had
their origin in certain local celebrations, namely, the torch race
and the race of the vintage festival, held at Athens. Similar races
took place at Sparta during the great national festival of the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Karneia">Κάρνεια</span> held in honor of Apollo.</p>

<p class="tp">In the preparation for these different kinds of foot-races everything
was done in the way of training that would tend to make the
body as light as possible and increase its rapidity, although the different
cities of Greece varied to some extent as regards the question
of diet, rubbing and baths.</p>

<p class="tp">In practising for the foot-race the contestant,
having divested himself of every shred of clothing and anointed
his body with oil, was made to exert himself as much as possible.
The exertion was often increased by making the run in deep sand
instead of on firm ground; the foot having a less firm support, the
runner was obliged to work harder and more quickly. In this way
these exercises gave to the body not only great power of endurance,
but also increased speed, and as a result the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="dolichodromoi">δολιχοδρόμοι</span>
possessed strong and well-developed legs. The shoulders and upper part
of the body, on the other hand, owing to insufficient exercise were
small and narrow. On that account Sokrates did not favor the races
because they did not produce a harmonious development of the body.
The skilled runner naturally strove to preserve an erect carriage
while running, and to conform to all established rules regarding the
contest.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span> In
this connection it may be interesting to mention the strange ideas
entertained among the Greeks regarding the influence of the spleen over
the powers of the body. This little organ, situated behind the stomach
on the left side of the abdomen, and exercising some function which
still remains unknown, would in their opinion if diseased prove a great
hindrance to a contestant in the race. In order, therefore, to prevent
such a catastrophe they resorted to extraordinary means, namely, the
use of certain plants which they believed would dissolve or eat away
the spleen; or even to surgical operations, such as cutting or burning
it out. On the other hand, they believed that a diseased spleen was
greatly benefited by exercise in running. Laomedon of Orchomenos is
quoted as furnishing an example of this kind.</p>

<p class="tp">The attitude of the runners we learn from vases. Those
who were contending in the short race or dash swung their arms backward
and forward alternately. This is beautifully shown by a painting on
a Panathenæan vase in the possession of Koller. It represents four
athletes running, hardly touching the ground with one foot, while
the other is raised and moved forward in order to cover the greatest
possible distance with one step. The hands are wide open; the arms
are moved about freely and appear to act as the wings of the body,
and their motion is in harmony with that of the lower limbs. Another
vase, discovered in the ancient tombs of Volci, also shows a similar
method of running. The athletes are moving rapidly, and using their
arms as wings. On the other hand, those who were running a long
distance clenched their fists and held their arms close to their
sides, as do our modern runners. A peculiar custom prevailed during
the games. It is said the contestants kept up a loud shouting in
order to retain their courage, while at the same time the admiring
spectators cheered wildly as some favorite or friend neared the
goal. As the Greeks did not possess the modern mechanical means
of communication, they had to rely mostly upon messengers; hence
the great necessity for expert runners. To this fact is due to a
considerable degree the development of agonistic and running contests
in Greece. It is said that after the battle of Platæa all the sacred
fires which had been profaned by the Persians were extinguished, and
that <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Enchidas">Ἐνχίδας</span>, a Platæan,
covered in one day the distance of a thousand stadia from Platæa
to Delphi and back again, and brought his fellow-citizens the pure
fire from the altar of Apollo. As a result of this terrible strain
he sank to the ground and died. The Cretans were especially noted in
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="dolichos">δόλιχος</span>.
Sotades and Ergoteles were among the most famous. The Arcadian Dromeos
was another celebrated runner, having been like the former twelve times
victorious in the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="dolichos">δόλιχος</span>.
Ladas, the famous Spartan runner, was also victorious in the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="dolichos">δόλιχος</span>,
but according to <a name="TN025_1" id="TN025_1"></a>Pausanias died
at the goal on completing a race.</p>

<p class="tp">Comparison of the speed of Hellenic athletes with that of
modern runners is exceedingly difficult, because the Hellenes had no
means of measuring minutes of time; they did not say of an athlete that
he ran the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="diaulos">δίαυλος</span> in such a
time, but that he won (<i>i. e.</i>, surpassed his competitors) in a certain
Olympic celebration.</p>

<p class="tp">Probably the next event was the pentathlon. This
competition was introduced into the festival at about the
18th Olympiad. As the etymology of the word signifies, the
pentathlon consisted of five distinct competitions, enumerated
in a well-known pentameter ascribed to Simonides: leaping
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="halma">ἅλμα</span>), running
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="podôkeiên">ποδωκείην</span>),
diskos-throwing (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="diskon">δίσκον</span>),
spear-throwing (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="akonta">ἄκοντα</span>),
wrestling (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="palên">πάλην</span>). That the
poet arranged the events in this order cannot be taken as positive
proof that this was the real order, as it is hard to see how these
words could be arranged otherwise in a pentameter. It is probable,
however, that wrestling was the final contest. There is some
uncertainty as to what constituted a victory in the pentathlon, but it
is evident that the purpose of this competition was to develop what we
call “all-round athletes,” and the assertion that the victor must have
won three out of the five contests cannot be far from the truth.</p>

<p class="tp">In such a combination of exercises it would certainly be good
athletic policy to make leaping the first contest. It may be questioned
whether an athlete could leap so well after having engaged
in the more violent exercises, whereas leaping itself, instead of disqualifying
for the other exercises, would on the contrary rouse the
animal spirits without bringing on exhaustion, and thereby put the
athletes at once in good condition. For the leap requires not only
vigor and elasticity, but also courage and determination.</p>

<p class="tp">The beneficent results of this exercise were recognized at a very
early period by the Hellenes, although in the heroic world the leap
was not considered so important as the other modes of contest. In
the games of Achilles the leap is not mentioned. In the Odyssey,
however, the <a name="TN025_2" id="TN025_2"></a>Phæacians, a
light-hearted people, more fond of amusement than of war, are said to
be skilled in leaping. It is in historic times, however, that leaping,
as an important event in the pentathlon of the public games, acquires
its technique, and receives the careful attention of athletes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p class="tp">What may be called the pure leap, that is the standing
leap without accessory aids, was not practised at Olympia. The leaper
held in his hands weights resembling our dumb-bells, and known as
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="haltêres">ἁλτῆρες</span>. To determine the dynamic
advantage of these weights is not easy, but it is certain that with
them the exercise required more skill, and accordingly more practice,
that it called into play more muscles, and that it was more attractive
to athletes as a mode of competition.</p>

<p class="tp">While little information can be obtained
from classic writers concerning the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="haltêres">ἁλτῆρες</span>,
much can be learned from archæological specimens.
<a name="TN026_1" id="TN026_1"></a>Pausanias describes them as
having the form of a semi-oval, or inaccurately-rounded ring that
could be grasped by the fingers as a shield was grasped. This
description corresponds with a drawing of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="haltêres">ἁλτῆρες</span>
on a vase in Hamilton’s second collection. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Haltêres">Ἁλτῆρες</span>
of another shape, however, resembling very closely the modern
dumb-bells, are seen on many other vases and gems. These had
both ends rounded, and were narrow in the middle in order that
they might be easily held. In Hamilton’s first collection
are vases giving representations of these <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="haltêres">ἁλτῆρες</span>.
In the Museo Borbonico may be seen on a patera a drawing in which the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="haltêres">ἁλτῆρες</span> have still another
form: when the hand has grasped the handle of these, beyond the hand,
on one side only, a club-shaped part protrudes. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="haltêres">ἁλτῆρες</span>
were usually made of lead.</p>

<p class="tp">In the pentathla, leaping never took place without <span
lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="haltêres">ἁλτῆρες</span>, which the athlete usually
held directly in front of him, and then, as he sprang, brought behind
him, thus helping to propel his body forward.</p>

<p class="tp">In addition to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="haltêres">ἁλτῆρες</span>,
professional athletes made use of another aid&mdash;the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="batêr">βατήρ</span>.
The latter was a board on which they stood before taking the leap, and
which may indeed have been provided with a spring.</p>

<p class="tp"><a name="TN026_2" id="TN026_2"></a>Pausanias especially
mentions the fact that the leaping of the pentathli in the Olympic
festival was accompanied by airs on the flute. This music was probably
to open the pentathlon, the most splendid and stirring of gymnastic
contests, as well as to increase the courage of the leapers.</p>

<p class="tp">The only leap that belonged to the pentathlon was the
standing long jump. There is no trace of anything like the hop,
step and jump. The figures of athletes on vases are represented
not as running, but as standing and swinging the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="haltêres">ἁλτῆρες</span>.
Then, too, it would seem that in the running jump the weights would be an
impediment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span> rather than an aid.
With the aid of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="haltêres">ἁλτῆρες</span>
and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="batêr">βατήρ</span> enormous distances
were covered. Phaÿllos of Rhegium is said to have covered more than
fifty-five feet at a leap. But the record is incredible. Some German
professors, however, are inclined to credit the record on the ground
that the ancients had studied the theory of leaping more scientifically
than have the moderns. For the sake of comparison the modern records
in jumping may be introduced. On May 28, 1890, J. Darby of England,
without the aid of weights, made a standing long jump of 12½ feet. At
Romeo, Mich., October 3, 1879, with 22-pound weights, G. W. Hamilton
made a standing jump of 14 feet, 5½ inches. A record of 23 feet, 6½
inches, in the running long jump has been made twice: by C. L. Reber at
Detroit, July 4, 1891, and by C. B. Frye of England, March 4, 1893. A
jump of 48 feet, 8 inches, without weights and preceded by a hop and a
step, was made October 18, 1884, by T. Burrows of Worcester.</p>

<p class="p0a tp">In the palæstra and the gymnasium, leaping was practised in
many different ways, as through a hoop, or over a rope. That the
high jump also was practised is evident from the fact that the athletes
leaped not only over pointed poles fixed in the ground, but
also over one another’s heads, after the manner of modern circus
performers. Leaping from a higher place to a lower was also practised.
Leaping took place in dancing and in various other sports.
A dance, consisting principally of leaping was practised at Sparta,
particularly by young women and girls. In this the dancers aimed
to hit their backs with their heels. Aristophanes alludes to this
custom in the following dialogue between Lysistrata and Lampito:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">In sooth, thy bust is lovely to behold.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="tp">It is probable that in the Olympic pentathlon leaping was followed
by diskos-hurling,&mdash;a contest of great antiquity. An old
myth represents Apollo as a diskos-thrower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p class="tp">The diskos was circular in form with perhaps an average diameter
of a little less than a foot, and was made of various materials
at different periods and places. The heroic diskos, as has been
said, was made of stone, while that of a later period was of metal,
and even of wood. The diskos in common use at the Olympic
festival was metallic, and resembled a small shield.</p>

<p class="tp">In the local gymnasia the size and weight of the diskos varied
in order that an athlete might select one in accord with his strength.
But in the men’s pentathlon at the public games a standard diskos
was required,&mdash;uniform in material, form, and weight, in order that
the strength and skill of the competitors might be impartially tested
and the victory correspondingly awarded. There is considerable
doubt as to the dimensions and weight of this standard diskos. It
is likely that the weight was between four and five pounds. A
specimen found at Ægina and now preserved among the bronzes
at Munich is about eight inches in diameter and slightly less than
four pounds in weight. But another specimen at present in the
British Museum weighs twelve pounds.</p>

<p class="tp">There is also doubt as to the distance to which a skilful athlete
could hurl the diskos. An extravagant record of one hundred
cubits is preserved in the writings of Philostratos. It is probable,
however, that one hundred feet was an extraordinary throw and
was exceeded only by the best athletes. While it is unlikely that
the throws of renowned athletes were carelessly measured at the
time, it is probable that many subsequent accounts were more or
less exaggerated. It is well to bear in mind that the statue of
<a name="TN028_1" id="TN028_1"></a>Phaÿllos was greatly admired
among the Greeks because that athlete had thrown the diskos ninety-five
feet.</p>

<p class="tp">It is interesting in this connection to note that at the International
Athletic Games, celebrated at Athens in 1896, the victor
in the diskos-throwing competition made a record of 95.64 feet.
The diskos used in this competition weighed 4¾ pounds. Although
three skilful Greek athletes participated in this competition
and exhibited a technique much superior to that of the foreign
competitors, yet the victory was won by Mr. Garret, an American,
who though never having handled the diskos before threw it to the
above distance, thereby surpassing the best throw of M. Paraskevopoulos,
the Greek champion, by .64 feet.</p>

<p class="tp">To return to the ancient contests, the Homeric heroes practised
diskos-throwing without completely disrobing,&mdash;the upper garment
only being laid aside. But at Olympia after the 15th Olympiad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>
all clothing was dispensed with, and the advantage of entire nudity
in this sport came to be clearly recognized. Nudity characterized,
of course, the diskoboloi of the other great athletic festivals.
Again, while the Homeric heroes did not anoint the body with oil,
the athlete of historic times did not consider his preparation complete
without it.</p>

<p class="tp">After roughening his hands and the diskos with earth, in order
to grasp it more firmly and handle it more deftly, the diskobolos
ascended an eminence, called the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="balbis">βαλβίς</span>.
When about to throw, the body of the diskobolos was bent quite a little
to the right and forward. At the same time the head was bent to the
right so far that it was possible for him to see the upper left side
of his body. The right arm was now moved from below, first backward to
the height of the shoulders, and then with a rapid movement forward
it described a semi-circle, giving the diskos at once velocity and
direction. In throwing the diskos, the diskobolos rested first on the
right foot and then on the left. At the moment of hurling the diskos
the left knee was slightly bent, while the other was kept backward.
As the diskos left his hand he took one or more steps forward, like a
person throwing a ball in a bowling alley.</p>

<p class="tp">Again we are indebted to the archæologist who has brought to
the light of day not only statues but also vases and gems with
their elaborate scenes of the diskobolos in various attitudes, for
they reveal to us many facts about which the ancient historians are
silent.</p>

<p class="p0a tp">In classifying these works of art three different attitudes may be
recognized:</p>

<p class="p0 p0a tp">(1) The diskobolos preparing to throw.</p>

<p class="p0 p0a tp">(2) The diskobolos in the act of throwing.</p>

<p class="p0 tp">(3) The diskobolos having hurled the diskos and still following
it with his eyes, or where he has already been declared victor.</p>

<p class="tp">In the Museo Pio Clementino is a statue representing an athlete
about to hurl the diskos. In his left hand he is testing the weight
of the diskos, but holding the right ready to receive it and hurl it
into space. This statue was supposed by Visconti to be a copy of
a diskobolos by Naukydes, the pupil of Polykleitos. Many other
copies are also seen on vases and gems. On one of Hamilton’s
vases the diskobolos holds the diskos in his right hand, supporting
its weight in his left.</p>

<p class="tp">Of the statues representing the athlete in the act of throwing,
we will consider only Myron’s Diskobolos, the beau ideal of athletic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
motion, famous even in antiquity. Eight copies in a more or
less mutilated condition have come down to us. That which was
found in the Villa Palombara in 1781 on the Esquiline is the
best reproduction of the original. This statue passed from the
palace known as that of the <i>Massimi alle Colonne</i> to the <i>Lancelotti
Palace</i>, Rome, where it still remains. The attitude of the diskobolos
is very nearly that described by Lucian and Quintilian. In
the <i>Philopseudes</i>&mdash;1, 8, Lucian gives the following description of
Myron’s Diskobolos: “Thou speakest of the disk-thrower, who is
bending forward for the throw, with his face turned away towards
the hand that holds the disk, and with one foot slightly pointed, as
if he would raise himself with the action of throwing.”</p>

<p class="tp">The statue reveals probably the most approved attitude of a
diskobolos just before making a throw. The centre of gravity falls
upon the right foot, which, though the leg is bent in a slight curve,
rests firmly on the ground; both legs are bent at the knees, but
the left more acutely; the right fore-leg is perpendicular, while the
left is thrust backward obliquely; the left foot, forming a noticeable
curve, is upright and touches the ground only at the tips of
the toes; the thighs, close together, slant upward, making an angle
of over 45° with the ground; the upper part of the body is bent
forward, and is steadied by the left arm whose hand rests against
the right knee; the upper half of the body is twisted to the right;
the right arm is extended backwards and is straight; the fingers
of the right hand, which is somewhat above the level of the right
shoulder, firmly grip the edge of the diskos; the head is turned so
far to the right that the right side of the body is plainly visible;
the eyes are fastened on the diskos.</p>

<p class="tp">It is evident that the diskobolos must have swung the disk in a
semi-circle, and have hurled it from below forward, and that the
whole body must have relaxed and readjusted itself as the right
arm moved forward and imparted the pent-up energy to the disk.</p>

<p class="tp">The pose of the large cast in the Boston Athenæum, as well as
that of the cast in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, is not in accordance
with Lucian’s description. Both represent the head as
not turned aside but directly forward, with the eyes looking straight
ahead. There is, however, in the Fourth Greek Room, a cast of a
small bronze statuette, which is preserved in the Antiquarium at
Munich. This is in many respects an excellent copy of Myron’s
diskobolos. In the catalogue of the casts in the Museum, this
statuette is pronounced especially satisfactory from an æsthetic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span>
point of view because the line of equilibrium falls perpendicularly
through the centre from whatever point of view the statuette is
seen.</p>

<p class="tp">Besides this copy of Myron’s statue, we find on many vases and
gems the diskobolos in the act of hurling the diskos. For instance,
on one of Hamilton’s vases we see a diskobolos with a diskos in
his right hand, while the right arm is bent and held forward, showing
that he is on the point of moving the arm backward, and then
forcibly hurling the diskos from below, forward. The left arm is
bent over the head, the eyes are fixed on the diskos, the right foot
is placed forward, so that the centre of gravity falls on the left,
which is obliquely bent at the knee.</p>

<p class="tp">We will now consider the third class of statues, gems and vase-paintings
representing the diskobolos as having thrown the diskos,
and still following it with his eye, or where he has already been
declared victor and adorned with the palm. In 1754 there was
discovered at Herculaneum the bronze statue of a diskobolos from
whose hand the diskos has just flown. He is still standing, however,
with the upper portion of his body bent forward, the eyes
looking sharply into space, the face full of expectation. The position
of the right arm indicates that the hand is only just freed from
the heavy diskos. Both feet are placed wide apart, as may be observed
in several other instances, at the moment of throwing. In
the <i>Galerie de Florence</i> is a gem which represents a diskobolos who
has been declared victor. He holds the diskos in his left hand, the
palm of victory in his right. At his right stands a prize cup, while
at his left is a tripod upon which is a wreath and a palm. A painting
from Herculaneum also represents a diskobolos after having
thrown the diskos.</p>

<p class="tp">If space permitted, many other statues, vase and gem pictures
could be cited to show the different positions of the skilled diskobolos.
But enough has been said to show that to hurl the diskos
through the air at once gracefully and effectively required the
greatest skill and dexterity, and was an art acquired only through
long practice. In diskos-throwing, distance, not height, determined
the victor. He who threw the farthest beyond the mark or σῆμα
was awarded the prize.</p>

<p class="p4a tp">Diskos-throwing was a good preparation for war, as it developed
great skill in stone-throwing&mdash;a very important feature in the war
practices of the ancients. This exercise must have developed to a
remarkable degree the muscles of the upper part of the body,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
shoulders, arms and hands&mdash;especially those of the right side of
the body. At the same time the feet were trained in a firm and
secure step, and, although the diskos was thrown at no fixed point,
the eye was nevertheless used and trained. So beneficial was the
exercise in certain cases that it was often ordered by the ancient
physicians. Among the Spartans the diskos was especially loved,
ostensibly on account of Apollo’s contest with Hyakinthos on Spartan
soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III. THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN ANCIENT TIMES.</h2>

<p class="tp">The third event of the pentathlon was spear-throwing. In the
athletic training of an Hellenic youth, spear-throwing came after
the hand and arm had been strengthened by ball-playing and
diskos-throwing.</p>

<p class="tp">Spear-throwing, as has been shown, growing out of the very
early necessity of war-training, was a primitive mode of exercise.
The spear (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="dory">δόρυ</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="lonchê">λόγχη</span>) used by the Homeric
heroes was very large, and as heavy as they could handle effectively.
None but that warrior himself could wield the spear of Achilles.
Hector’s spear was 16 feet long; the shaft was made of ash. A socket
was fitted to the upper end of the spear, in which was inserted a
bronze spear point. But that used at the pentathlon, and denoted by the
term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="akôn">ἄκων</span>, was smaller and lighter.</p>

<p class="tp">The attitude of the body, the movement of the arms and shoulders,
and the carriage of the head were very different in spear-throwing
from those in diskos-hurling. The athlete stood erect,
and raised his right arm upward and slightly backward; his right
foot was generally placed backward, while his left was advanced;
his eye was fixed on a goal straight ahead. He grasped the spear
in the middle and held it in a horizontal position on a level with
his right ear; sometimes he moved it backward and forward before
throwing, but as often omitted such preliminary exercise.
Sometimes it was thrown by means of a strap attached to it, as is
still the custom in many countries.</p>

<p class="tp">In the pentathlon, spear-throwing was a test rather of skill than
of strength; an athlete who could win the victory with the diskos
might suffer defeat with the spear, although diskos-throwing required
more strength than spear-throwing. Spear-throwing
trained the eye and made the arm deft in executing the eye’s
direction.</p>

<p class="tp">It conferred upon the body other peculiar benefits; the organs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
of respiration were stimulated; the chest was strengthened and
enlarged; the right arm was strengthened; in order to throw the
spear effectively the athlete must maintain a graceful poise and
have command of his entire body; to do so with a weight held
aloft, strengthened the lower limbs, made their muscles more
facile, and the step more sure.</p>

<p class="tp">By inserting this particular exercise into the pentathlon the
early Olympians not only recognized the foregoing advantages,
but they also honored the characteristic exercise of their ancestors,
and subsequent Olympians followed their example. For the
spear was the traditional sign of the freeman; as far back as myth
and memory could go, it had been carried, even in peace, as an
honorable and distinguishing token.</p>

<p class="tp">Plato, in his scheme of the ideal state, prescribed spear-throwing
as a training for war, and directed that it should be
practiced by women as well as by men.</p>

<p class="tp">At Rome, during the time of the emperors, spear-throwing was
included among the gymnastic exercises of that city. Instruction
in this art was received from the Mauritanians. But it is said
that the Emperor Commodus surpassed even the skill of his instructors;
in the amphitheatre he killed, according to the story, a
hundred lions with as many spears; at another time he astonished
the spectators by the dexterity with which he hurled his spear at
the Mauritanian ostriches, as they ran by the amphitheatre at full
speed; with every throw he severed a bird’s head from its body.</p>

<p class="tp">We have no accounts to show as to how far a Greek athlete
could hurl a spear, but we know that savages of today can hurl it
to a great distance. It is said by travellers that a Kaffir who suddenly
comes upon game will hit an antelope ten or fifteen yards
away without raising his arm.</p>

<p class="tp">The three events that have been described, leaping, diskos-throwing
and spear-throwing, were probably the essential features
of the pentathlon; that is to say, an athlete who won in all three
events was probably crowned victor. If, however, the victories
in the three events were not secured by the same man, the competition
was decided by additional contests in running and wrestling.
But as at other stages of the festival these two exercises were
distinct events, a description of their technique may be omitted
in this place. Among those who distinguished themselves in the
pentathlon, were included some of the most illustrious men of
Greece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p class="tp">The pentathlon was succeeded by horse and chariot races.</p>

<p class="tp">Chariot racing, even as far back as the heroic time, had attained
a high rank in the domain of antagonistics; it was, indeed, the
first contest in the funeral games of Patroklos. (Il. xxiii.
262-650.) In the minute and vivid description of Homer, the
nature of the contest and the arrangements are very clearly indicated.
There was no artificially constructed hippodrome. A
flat, open plain, with its natural irregularities and without buildings
of any sort, served as the race-course. The point of starting
was on the sea-coast, but the turning point was in the plain of
Troy. The goal, which was the stump of a tree, could be seen in
the far distance only by its having two white stones leaning
against it on either side. On account of the great distance, the
spectators were not able to distinguish between the approaching
horses. (Il. 450 ff.) Hence rose an altercation between Idomeneus
and Aias, as to whose chariot was leading in the race.
Achilles advised both to wait quietly until the horses were nearer
and the order of the chariots could be recognized by all.</p>

<p class="tp">With a very few points of difference, this description of Homer
gives a good idea of a chariot race at Olympia. The difference
consisted, first, in running the length of the course several times
instead of once, in order that a body of spectators might witness
the entire race; second, in the greater number of chariots, and
third, in the arrangements, whereby they might start without
confusion. In the games of Achilles, the chariots were five in
number, each with two horses and a single driver, who stood
upright in the chariot. As we have already mentioned, the
Homeric hero made use of two horses in the race as well as in
hostile combat, while the Olympic contestant did not limit himself
to two horses. In fact, the four-horse chariot-race, which
was introduced in the twenty-fifth Olympiad, was the first in
honor and in importance, and always remained the most popular.
In this contest, only kings, nobles, and the wealthy could take
part, on account of the great expense involved in rearing fine
horses, and in maintaining costly chariots. Very often, the victor
had his triumphs recorded on the state issues of coins.</p>

<p class="tp">Races on horseback date from the thirty-third Olympiad.
Philip of Macedon won in this contest, and celebrated his victory
by having an enormous horse, ridden by a diminutive jockey,
placed on his coinage. As this victory took place in the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
year in which Potidaea fell into his hands and his son Alexander
was born, he regarded that year as especially auspicious.</p>

<p class="tp">While the race of the quadrigæ of horses was introduced as
early as the twenty-fifth Olympiad, that of the bigæ of horses was
not introduced until the ninety-third Olympiad. A quadriga
consisted of four horses harnessed to a chariot; a biga, of two
horses. In the seventieth Olympiad, bigæ of mules were admitted,
but in the eighty-fourth Olympiad they were excluded; their
exclusion may be ascribed to two reasons: first, they presented an
unpleasing appearance; second, among the Eleians, according to
Pausanias, a curse had rested on the animals from ancient times.</p>

<p class="tp">Prior to the twenty-fifth Olympiad, all athletic contests had
taken place in the Stadion. As chariot-racing, however, demanded
more room, a separate race-course, called the
<a name="TN036_1" id="TN036_1"></a>Hippodrome, was established.
The site of the Hippodrome cannot be exactly traced. This is because
the Alpheios has washed away all certain indications of its limits.
But from the account of Pausanias (V, 4; VI, 20, 7 foll.) it may be
approximately located; it lay to the south of the Stadion and extended
roughly parallel with it, though stretching far beyond it to the east.
The German explorers who excavated Olympia inferred from the state
of the ground that the Hippodrome was about 2526 feet in length. The
Stadion and Hippodrome were closely connected, the rear part of the
aphesis, or starting point, of the Hippodrome adjoining the end of the
Stadion. At the farther end of the Hippodrome was the goal outside of
which the chariots had to turn. To round this goal with advantage, that
is, to keep as close to it as it was possible to do without upsetting
his own chariot or colliding with another, required long practice
and great dexterity on the part of the driver; it was indeed a very
dangerous feat; at every race a large number of the chariots involved
were wrecked, and in such accidents the charioteers rarely escaped
without serious injuries. According to legend, Orestes had met his
death at a Pythian festival; his chariot colliding with the goal, he
fell to the ground, became entangled in the reins, and was dragged or
trampled to death. After every turning of the goal, the chariots were
greeted with the sound of trumpets in order that men and horses might
attain new courage and vigor after so dangerous an ordeal.</p>

<p class="tp">The signal for the chariots to come out from the rooms allotted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
to them in the aphesis and form in line for the race was given by
an eagle which, by means of mechanism, rose into the air at the
same moment that a dolphin fell to the ground. Such a signal
was characteristic of the Greek; but in the Roman races, the
chariots started at the waving of a white cloth by a person of
distinction.</p>

<p class="tp">The equestrian contests at Olympia were succeeded by boxing.
Boxing for men was introduced at the Olympic festival in the
twenty-third Olympiad, and for boys in the thirty-seventh Olympiad.
But the sport was already very old, and its introduction at
Olympia was probably a recognition of its popularity and antiquity.
In fact, as the fist is the simplest and most natural
weapon of mankind, it is not surprising to find that boxing was
one of the earliest athletic games among the Hellenes. Homer’s
detailed description of the contest of the invincible Epeios with
Euryalos has already been mentioned, and Homer had probably
heard many similar tales of the prowess of <a name="TN037_1" id="TN037_1"></a>Mycenæan boxers.
Polydeukes, the bravest boxer among the pre-Homeric heroes, is
said to have defeated the strong Amykos. The latter was a
teacher of the art, and allowed no stranger to depart from his
country without challenging him to a pugilistic contest. Apollo
himself, the gracious companion and leader of the Pierides, is
described as engaging in a boxing contest at Olympus with Ares,
the powerful god of war; perhaps in this myth there is a suggestion
of the advantage which the nimble and quick-witted boxer
sometimes has over a more bulky one. In the mythical founding
of the Nemean games, Tydeus was victorious in a boxing contest.
In the passage of Virgil’s Æneid (Book V, 401 ff.), which so
closely resembles the twenty-third Book of the Iliad, the aged
Entellus vanquishes the young and boastful Dares. This contest
showed a complete system of striking and parrying.</p>

<p class="tp">It is quite likely that these and many other similar legends
augmented the natural interest in the sport, and hastened its
introduction into the greatest of all athletic festivals. But at
Olympia the sport was marked with variations. Whereas, for
instance, the Homeric heroes, when boxing, had protected their
bodies by means of a girdle around the loins (Il. XXIII, 683),
the Olympian athletes, being already accustomed to nudity in the
wrestling and racing contests, dispensed with such protection.
Again, from the first, Olympian boxers oiled the body, contrary
to the practice of Homeric athletes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p class="tp">Probably very few of the tactics of modern pugilists were unknown
to the Greek athletes. Some of the accessories of a
modern ring-fight, such as the “preliminary hand-shake,” tossing
for corners, etc., were of course wanting; particularly noticeable
was the absence of ropes and stakes; there was no referee to
enforce so strict a code of ethics as the Marquis of Queensberry
rules, fair play being secured by the voice of the people. Grasping
or hugging the opponent was not permitted; it was in the
elimination of such tactics that boxing differed from the pankration,
a combination of boxing and wrestling. Kicking was likewise
forbidden.</p>

<p class="tp">The set-to of Greek boxers probably resembled very closely
that of modern pugilists. The ancient descriptions of the manner
of giving and guarding or blocking blows are rather vague; but
on antique vases may be seen representations of boxers facing
one another in well-balanced attitudes, their heads thrown back,
and their arms well advanced, in the manner of the best modern
pugilism. In a famous Greek painting of boxers, one of the men
stands with his left foot and hand advanced, his left arm slightly
bent, and his right arm held across his lower chest, in fact, just as
Fitzsimmons or Corbett would stand when expecting a blow. In
the beginning of the contest, the boxer was sparing of his strength
and preferred to assume the defensive position, and so wear out
his opponent. It was, of course, considered a merit for a boxer to
conquer without receiving wounds.</p>

<p class="tp">The principal differences between the technique of Olympian
boxing and that of modern pugilism must be ascribed to the use
at Olympia of that cruel boxing weapon known as the cæstus.
This consisted of a heavy thong of dry, hardened leather, wound
about the palm of the hand so as to form a formidable ridge of
considerable circumference; it was even rendered more formidable
by being loaded with lead, and studded with little metal
projections. This nail-studded covering was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="sphaira">σφαῖρα</span>,
and was unknown to the ancient Greeks. That it was very dangerous is
shown by the fact that when used in the practice gymnasia, it was
itself covered, in order that young athletes might become accustomed
to its use before subjecting themselves to its deadliness. But even
more brutal than these were the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="myrmêkes">μύρμηκες</span>,
called the breakers or crushers of limbs. One cannot conceive of a
more formidable covering for the hand, unless it be the terrible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
cæstus of the Romans, to which Virgil alludes in the memorial games
of Anchises (Æn. V, 401): “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tantorum ingentia septem
Terga boum plumbo insuto ferroque rigebant.</span>” “So terrible was
the seven-fold bullhide stiffened with patches of lead and iron.” An
examination of the representations of hands armed with this covering
makes it evident that the straight blow or counter would not only fail
to make the weapon effective, but would, if forcible enough, crush the
fingers of the boxer between the leather and the adversary’s body. The
cæstus must, therefore, have been used for round blows, or for the old
English blow called the “chopper”; these were delivered by the back of
the hand in an outward and downward swing, and, to be given without
injury to the one who dealt them, required considerable skill.</p>

<p class="tp">The blows were directed at the upper parts of the body, and
the wounds inflicted on the head, the temples, ears, cheeks and
nose, were very severe and frequently proved fatal. The teeth
were often broken or injured. It is related of Eurydamas, the
Cyrenean, that his teeth were knocked out by his adversary, but
that he quietly swallowed them in order to conceal from him how
much he was injured; his adversary, disheartened by the apparently
small effect of his powerful blow, lost hope and allowed
Eurydamas to win the victory. The ears, especially, were exposed
to great danger, and those of regular pugilists were usually
so mutilated and swollen that the phrase “fighter’s ear” became a
stereotyped expression. Little covers for the ear, known as
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="auphôtires">αὐφώτιρες</span>, were invented
for gymnasium work, but they were not used in public games. Boxers, on
account of the bruises and disfigurations that usually marked their
features, were the subjects of numerous epigrammatic jests. Here is a
sample from the pen of a comic poet:</p>

<p class="tp">“After twenty years,” says the author of the epigram, “Ulysses
was recognized from his appearance returning to his home, by
his dog, Argos. But thou, Stratophon, after boxing for four
hours, hast been so altered, that neither dogs nor any person in
the town could possibly recognize thee. And if thou lookest at
thy face in a mirror, thou thyself wilt swear that thou art not
Stratophon.”</p>

<p class="tp">Of the boxer Olympikos, a poet says that he once had a nose, a
beard, eyebrows, ears and eyelids, but that when he had inscribed
his name among the pugilists he lost them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p class="tp">The only protection against the wound-dealing cæstus, aside
from skill in blocking blows, was a cap of bronze that was worn
by boxers at Olympia.</p>

<p class="tp">Another noteworthy point of difference between Olympian and
modern boxing is that instead of maintaining silence during the
contest, as do the moderns, the Olympians accompanied their
blows with certain inarticulate sounds, believing that their force
was thereby increased. Modern stone-masons frequently do the
same.</p>

<p class="tp">The contest at Olympia did not end until one of the combatants
was rendered unconscious, or was compelled by fatigue,
wounds or despair to declare himself conquered, which he signified
by lifting his right hand.</p>

<p class="tp">In this connection it is interesting to trace the evolution of
boxing in Greece. At first, of course, the bare fist was used; but
as time went on, boxers learned to cover their fists and wrists with
strips of undressed <a name="TN040_1" id="TN040_1"></a>oxhide, the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="himantas eutmêtous boos agrauloio">ἱμάντας ἐϋτμήτους βοὸς <a name="TN040_3" id="TN040_3"></a>ἀγραύλοιο</span>
in the contest of Epeios and Euryalos (Il. XXIII, 684).
Homer mentions these <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="himantes">ἱμάντες</span>
as if they were very common. The name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="meilichai">μειλίχαι</span>
was given them by later writers, because they dealt a mild blow; they
are described by Pausanias (VIII, 40, 3) as made of raw
<a name="TN040_2" id="TN040_2"></a>oxhide, cut into thin strips and
braided according to the custom of the ancients. The strips were wound
round the palm, leaving the fingers uncovered, at least enough so that
they could be bent to form a clenched fist. As the name indicates,
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="meilichai">μειλίχαι</span> were not cruel
weapons; they served not only to moderate the force of the blow, but
also to protect the hand from injury. They were used at the Nemean
games as late as the famous contest between Kreugas and Damoxenos.
It is likely that with these soft coverings the technique of blows
conformed more nearly with the modern technique. It has been already
shown that the straight counter was rendered impracticable by the
cæstus. But without the cæstus the Greek was very skillful with this
blow. The Greek also understood the advantage of the cross-counter,
a blow sometimes thought to be a comparatively recent discovery in
pugilism. If the Homeric description of the bare-handed fight between
Odysseus and the impudent ruffian and parasite, Iros, be analyzed, the
blow will be found plainly involved. Iros, who is of gigantic size, has
insulted Odysseus. A ring is formed and they begin to fight (Od. XVIII,
73-231).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“On his right shoulder Iros laid his stroke,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Odysseus struck him just beneath the ear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His jaw-bone broke, and made the blood appear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When straight he strewed the dust.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="tp">The blow of Odysseus must have been a cross-counter. Iros
leads with his left at Odysseus’ head, but the blow falls instead on
his right shoulder. Odysseus avoids the blow just as a trained
boxer would avoid a similar one today; that is to say, he moves
his head to the left, and catches the blow on his right shoulder,
at the same moment, “rising to the stroke.” He then crosses
Iros’ arm with his right, strikes him beneath the ear, and breaks
his jaw, thereby “knocking him out.”</p>

<p class="tp">The introduction and use of the cæstus, brought about by the
blood-thirstiness of the ancient mob, instead of being in the interest
of further skill was decidedly a backward step. For not only
did it improperly limit the technique of blows, as has been shown,
but it was too sure a menace to the very source of human skill,
the senses and consciousness itself.</p>

<p class="tp">Solon praised boxing from an educational point of view. Cato
the elder must have entertained a high opinion of this art, for,
according to Plutarch, he himself instructed his son, with whose
education he took the greatest pains, in the art of boxing.</p>

<p class="tp">In justification of this praise, it must be remembered that
Greek boxing, aside from its brutal features, had also its æsthetic
side. A graceful carriage, dexterity, and promptness of activity
were cultivated. We find Apollo, the embodiment of youthful
grace and beauty, and the ideal of Hellenic æstheticism, represented
as a boxer. Even from the medical point of view, boxing
was highly esteemed. Aretaios recommends it for vertigo and
chronic headache (De Morb. Dint. Cur. 1, 2).</p>

<p class="tp">This sport engaged young men of the noblest families in all
parts of Hellas. Pythagoras is said to have been victorious when
a youth in a boxing contest at Olympia. Rhodes, Ægina, Arkadia
and Elis were noted for producing skilled pugilists.</p>

<p class="tp">Boxing was followed by wrestling and the pankration which
were the final competitions. As is well known, wrestling was one
of the most popular sports among the Greeks, from the days of
Homer. According to mythology, Palaistra, the daughter of
Hermes, established the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="palê">πάλη</span>,
while her brother, Autolykos,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
is mentioned as the instructor of the young Herakles in this art.
Plato also assigns the origin of wrestling to the earliest times and
declares Antaios and Kerkyon to be the most ancient wrestlers.
But the mode of wrestling was the result of a mere desire to
fight, and so did not develop wrestling as an art. Theseus is said
to have been the first to reduce it to a system and to practice it
according to definite rules. We have already mentioned how
Homer, in the games of Achilles, causes the powerful Telamonian
Aias and Odysseus to engage in a wrestling bout. Wrestling
matches were among the chief events in the famous games at
Olympia and elsewhere. They were introduced earlier than
boxing and were believed to show off the strength, activity and
grace of the body to more advantage than any other contest. No
other exercise required such perfect development of every muscle
in the body, or an equal combination of strength and agility.</p>

<p class="tp">Plutarch calls wrestling the most artistic and cunning of athletic
sports. It was as full of tricks and feints as that of modern
times. The opponent was often deceived by feigned positions
and movements. Sometimes the wrestler would feint as if to
grasp his adversary in a certain place, but by a quick, cat-like
movement would attack him in another which had been left exposed.
Cunning was likewise practiced by the Homeric heroes.
Odysseus overpowered Aias by striking him in the hollow of the
knee. But while wrestling was characterized by tricks, the observance
of certain rules was insisted on at Olympia. Striking,
kicking, and pushing were prohibited, but, strange to say, disjointing
an opponent’s fingers was allowed, probably on the ground
that it involved grasping.</p>

<p class="tp">While the Greeks in their athletic sports sought for grace and
symmetry as well as strength, it is nevertheless true that their
wrestlers were noted for their bulk. Corpulency was considered
advantageous for a wrestler for two reasons: first, the increased
weight rendered it less easy for an opponent to lift him off the
ground; second, it was easier for him, on the other hand, to overpower
his adversary at the opportune moment. Nevertheless, a
graceful style of wrestling, while less easy to attain under this
condition, was much sought after. And oftentimes grace is the
concomitant of a skill that possesses a sure advantage over mere
bulk. Very joyous were the Olympic spectators when this fact
was demonstrated. When the boy Kratinos of Aigeira was victorious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>
in a match in which skill was more apparent than mere
strength, the authorities permitted him to have placed in the Altis
not only his own statue, but that of his teacher. Pausanias says
that Kratinos exhibited a more graceful style than any other
wrestler of his time.</p>

<p class="tp">Two modes of wrestling were in vogue at Olympia, standing
and ground wrestling; the former, called the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="triagmos">τριαγμός</span>,
was most common. The contestants stood upright, face to face, and after
one had been thrown and had risen, the contest was renewed. This was
the style practiced by the Homeric heroes. After Aias and Odysseus had
thrown each other to the ground, they rose and continued the struggle.
Victory was bought with three throws. Standing wrestling was practiced
in later times at all the great games. Plato, especially, prefers
this style, as it develops the upper parts of the body, the arms,
shoulders, chest and neck. In the latter, or ground wrestling, when the
combatants had fallen they continued the struggle on the ground, until
one acknowledged himself conquered. This kind of wrestling belonged
especially to the pankration, and like that cruel contest was unknown
in heroic times. Solon, according to Lucian, claims that this mode is
of great value as a preparation for war. Plato, however, does not so
regard it. Dion Cassius, in his description of a battle between the
Romans and the Jazyges on the ice of the Danube, claimed that in this
particular instance, familiarity with ground wrestling was especially
advantageous.</p>

<p class="tp">Of the numerous tricks, feints and holds practiced by the
Greeks, the following were the most noteworthy. The antagonist
endeavored to throw his opponent either by tripping him, or by
grasping his foot with his hand. This latter style is differently
illustrated on two vases. On the first vase the antagonist is represented
as grasping with his right hand his opponent’s foot, which
he has raised to a line with the middle of his body, while with the
left arm he is further raising the thigh, thus forcing his opponent
to the ground. On the second vase, the contestant has raised his
opponent’s foot and is holding it up with the left hand, which is
placed under the knee; both contestants are moving the right
arm as if preparing to strike. This probably represents the pankration,
as striking was not allowed in the wrestling bout. A
similar illustration is seen on a coin; but here the antagonist,
whose foot is held by his opponent, holds the latter in his arms
in order to drag him down if he should fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p class="tp">Another trick, in which the athlete wound his leg around his
opponent’s thigh, was often practiced. This point is beautifully
illustrated by the famous group of wrestlers in the Uffizi Gallery,
Florence, of which a fine cast may be seen in the Boston Museum
of Fine Arts. Winckelmann considers these wrestlers to be the
sons of Niobe, as they were found in 1583 at the same time and
place as the Niobe group. According to the legend, they were
engaged in a wrestling match when slain by Apollo’s arrows.</p>

<p class="tp">The technical names of the various locks and holds which have
come down to us do not give a clear and definite idea of wrestling.
If one of the Hellenic gymnastes, who must have written accounts
of the different modes of wrestling, had left behind a complete
list of movements, or if the most important parts of the literature
bearing upon gymnastics and agonistics had been preserved, we
might form a more definite conception of the wrestling match.
To the student of athletics it may be interesting to mention a few
expressions which have come down to us from this ancient nomenclature.
The word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="drassein">δράσσειν</span> which
literally means to seize or grasp the hand, was probably applied to
the alternate grasping of the arms. This movement is beautifully
illustrated on many antique works of Greek art, especially on vases,
gems and coins. It was one of the chief manœuvres of the wrestlers
and might have occurred at the beginning of the contest. Plutarch
designates the different modes of attack, position and manœuvres of the
wrestlers by the terms <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="embolai">ἐμβολαί</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="parembolai">παρεμβολαί</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="systaseis">συστάσεις</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="paratheseis">παραθέσεις</span>,
from which general conceptions may be formed, but hardly
clear imagery. The following Greek words,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="ôthismoi"><a name="TN044_1" id="TN044_1"></a>ὠθισμοί</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="periplokai">περιπλοκαί</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="lygismoi">λυγισμοί</span>, which literally
mean pushing, grasping and twisting the limbs, were used by
Lucian to express different styles of wrestling. The terms
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="synaphê">συναφή</span> and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="katochê">κατοχή</span> used by Hesychios
when speaking of athletics, can apply only to the wrestling
match itself. The movement whereby the antagonist is forced
from his position is described by the term
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="apagein">ἀπάγειν</span>, literally to lead
away or carry off. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Anchein">Ἄγχειν</span>
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="apopnigein">ἀποπνίγειν</span> describe
the grasping of the neck and choking, in order to prevent respiration.
This trick of grasping the opponent’s neck and then throttling him
until he acknowledged himself conquered was considered a very cunning
act. Sometimes the wrestler would obstruct respiration by forcing his
elbow under the chin of his adversary, or he would attempt to bring
the neck of the latter between his thighs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[Pg 47]</span>
and then exert such pressure as almost to strangle him. This occurred
more frequently in the ground wrestling. On a gem is portrayed a group
of boy wrestlers, one of whom, while resting on his right knee, is
firmly holding by the throat his opponent, who is on both knees; to the
right stands a prize vase with a palm, to the left, an umpire with a
rod.</p>

<p class="tp">The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="hamma">ἅμμα</span> involved grasping
the opponent in such a manner that he could be held in a position
that would tire him and perhaps exhaust his energy. Herakles in his
wrestling contest with the mighty giant, Antaios, was believed to have
used this trick; but Herakles held his antagonist in the air. Running
toward each other with lowered heads for the purpose of butting, after
the manner of rams, also belonged to the province of wrestling, and was
practiced by Lucian himself in the Lykeion at Athens.</p>

<p class="tp">Plato protests against right-handedness (Laws, 8-794). He
demands that a trained wrestler, pankratiast and boxer should be
able to use both hands equally, so that if his opponent should succeed
in turning him around he could defend himself from the
other side. The wrestler would sometimes endeavor to place
himself behind his adversary by a quick movement, then wind his
leg around his opponent’s body and throw him. If successful in
this attempt he would choke him.</p>

<p class="tp">Besides these tricks there were others with the fingers. For
instance, a wrestler would grasp his opponent’s finger-tips and disjoint
or break them, not letting go until the pain compelled his victim
to declare himself conquered. This finger contest sometimes
preceded the actual contest, and was oftentimes the only feature.
Sostratos of Sikyon was specially famed for this mode of contest;
he was twelve times victorious in the Nemean and Isthmian, twice
in the Pythian and three times in the Olympian games. Leontiskos
of Messina, in Sicily, also practiced wrestling in this manner
and gained his victory by breaking his opponent’s fingers.</p>

<p class="p4a tp">In ground wrestling the athlete even attempted to break his
opponent’s toes. Another special scheme which belonged to the
standing wrestling was as follows: the contestant made a circle
around himself and challenged his opponent to force him from
his position. If the latter failed to do this, the victory belonged
to the former. Especially noted in this style of wrestling was Milo
of Crotona, the most famous wrestler of antiquity. When a mere
boy he was victorious in the Olympic and Pythian games. Six<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>
times his head was crowned with the sacred olive of Olympia.
Young men of the noblest families engaged in these wrestling
contests. Plato, when a youth, is said to have been victorious in
the Pythian and Isthmian games, probably in the wrestling
match.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV. TOYS AND GAMES FOR CHILDREN AMONG THE
ANCIENT HELLENES.</h2>

<p class="tp">We have endeavored to describe at its height the system of
professional athletics in ancient Hellas. Such a system must necessarily
have influenced the more widespread practices whereby the
young developed their bodies, just as today the system of professional
athletics is a model for college training and exerts an influence
upon the sports of even young children. But professional
athletics, even in ancient Hellas, must be regarded as quite distinct
from that important phase of Hellenic education called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="gymnastikê">γυμναστική</span>.</p>

<p class="tp">In Sparta physical culture was a stern business and could by no
means be styled a pastime; it was almost the sole requisite of
education. But it was in Sparta that professional athletics were
held in least favor. Spartan authorities did not delude themselves;
being thoroughly in earnest to produce a race that was hardy
and valiant to the last degree, and regarding physical culture as a
serious and all-engrossing business rather than an exciting amusement,
they quickly discerned that the specialism of professional
athletics was detrimental to this end.</p>

<p class="tp">The greatness and welfare of the state was the standard whereby
all Spartan life was regulated. The needs of the state were ever
uppermost in the minds of Spartan authorities. They neither
deluded themselves in their estimate of these needs, nor did they
even dream of a compassion that would deter them from establishing
and executing regulations whereby these needs would be met.
In Sparta the unfortunate individual who did not conform in
promise or attainment to the criterion of a Spartan citizen found no
pity.</p>

<p class="tp">And what was the criterion of the Spartan citizen? It was the
man, without defect of body, who had learned not merely to stifle
outward show of fear, but who had early learned to be absolutely
fearless, who had learned to be calm while suffering agonizing
pain; it was the man whose powers of endurance were very great,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[Pg 50]</span>
who could march long distances over a rough country without
fatigue, who could then halt and await the onset of an enemy with
a glad and confident heart, and who could engage his enemy and
be victorious; it was the man who loved combat.</p>

<p class="tp">The Spartan state possessed absolute authority over its citizens
through all stages of their lives. Even before birth that authority
was exerted; for the state prescribed the age at which citizens
should marry, and approved or vetoed all propositions of marriage.
If at the present day we exercised the same care to bring sound
children into the world there would be little need of being “born
again.” Spartan infants were subjected to the judgment of a
body of selected citizens, and if approved by the latter became
thenceforth the objects of the care and direction of the state, but
if condemned as not promising health and vigor they were killed.
According to Plutarch unhealthy infants were exposed in the
apothetæ, a sort of chasm under Taygetos (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Taugetos">Ταΰγετος</span>)
and left to die.</p>

<p class="tp">Until the age of seven, Spartan children were left to the care
of their parents, but even during this early period they received a
foretaste of future deprivations and exercises. Their food was very
plain and limited in quantity. Care was taken to eradicate the
little fears of childhood. They were taught not to be afraid in the
dark or when left alone.</p>

<p class="tp">Many interesting little sports were in vogue
among Hellenic children, and it may well be believed that in
Sparta they were practised with a peculiar earnestness. Most
of the amusements of modern children were also the delight of
Hellenic children, while some of the sports of the latter are
no longer in use. Even the infant’s rattle (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="platagê">πλαταγή</span>)
was a Greek toy ascribed to the invention of the philosopher, Archytas.
Then there were hoops (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="trochoi">τροχοί</span>
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="krikoi">κρίκοι</span>). The
childish game of rolling the hoop was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="krikêlasia">κρικηλασία</span>.
The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="krikos">κρίκος</span> corresponded to the Roman
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">trochus</span> described by Horace (<i>Ode</i> 3; 24,
57) and Ovid, as well as by Propertius, Martialis, and other
writers. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="krikos">κρίκος</span> was a
large hoop probably of iron or copper. According to Antyllos, its
diameter was less than the height of a man, reaching probably to
his chest. The implement used in rolling it is said to have been a
crooked-necked iron with a wooden handle, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="elatêr">ἐλατήρ</span>
(Mart. xiv, 169). Sometimes, as with us, the hoop was set round with
small metal rings or bells which when in motion caused a jingling
sound very pleasing to a child’s ears. Some regarded these rings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span>
as unnecessary, but Antyllos favored them on the ground that
the sound they produced added much to the child’s happiness and
engaged his attention in a pleasant way. Antyllos also considered
this game to be a very healthful form of exercise and <a name="TN049_1" id="TN049_1"></a>advised
that it be practised immediately before bathing and eating. The
familiar top (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="bembêx">βέμβηξ</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="bembix">βέμβιξ</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="rhombos"><a name="TN049_2" id="TN049_2"></a>ῥόμβος</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="strobilos">στρόβιλος</span>), old as the
days of Homer, was a common amusement with Greek boys, as in our own
times&mdash;“<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="strombon d’ hôs esseue balôn, peri d’ edrame pantê">στρόμβον δ’ ὣς ἔσσευε βαλών, περὶ δ’ ἔδραμε πάντη</span>”
(<i>Il.</i> xiv, 413).</p>

<p class="tp">The humming top, used by Greek and Roman children and
made to revolve by whipping, is also prettily alluded to by Virgil
in the following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ceu quondam torto volitans sub verbere turbo,</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quem pueri magno in gyro vacua atria circum</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Intenti ludo exercent.</span>”</div>
    <div class="verse indent25"><i>Æneid</i> vii, 378-380.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="tp">Kite-flying also seems to have been known to the Greek children.
Stilts (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="kalobathra">καλόβαθρα</span>) were much
used by children and also by adults in certain mimic dances. The girls
had dolls (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="korai">κόραι</span>) of wax or
clay, and the usual paraphernalia connected with this ever popular
plaything. Many of these, which still survive, show that they
were painted and that the arms and legs were so fastened with
strings as to be easily movable. The word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="korê">κόρη</span>
literally means a “little girl.” At marriage the Greek girls dedicated
their dolls to Artemis, the Roman girls to Venus. If they died unwedded,
their dolls were buried with them. The terms <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="dagynon">δάγυνον</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="dagys">δαγύς</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="plangôn">πλαγγών</span>
were often applied by the Greeks to the wax doll.</p>

<p class="tp">The swing <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="aiôra">αἰώρα</span> occupied
the same position in Greece as in our nurseries. Then there were clappers
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="plêktra">πλῆκτρα</span>), toy-carts
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="hamaxides">ἁμαξίδες</span>), hobby-horses
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="hippidia xylina">ἱππίδια ξύλινα</span>),
toy soldiers and animals, made of clay.</p>

<p class="tp">In addition to these toys, many games may be mentioned.
From the standpoint of education, games for children are worthy
of consideration. For, if human nature is most plainly shown in
sport, then from these games one can obtain a clear idea of a child’s
character, inclination and intellect, the recognition of which should
be of utmost importance to the educator. Games also furnish endless
and varied material for the cultivation of the child’s mental
powers and natural talents, which are developed by physical exercise.
The Spartan children were superior to the other Greek
children in the power of expression, although they were not so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>
highly educated. This is no doubt due to the fact that at a very
early age the Spartan children were forced into a free life in the
open air and to systematic gymnastic exercise. The Romans, also
though they did not consider gymnastics of so much importance as
did the Hellenes, did not neglect them. Being a warlike people,
they began to develop and strengthen the body of the child at an
early age. The sports of childhood are as important to the boy as
work is to the man, and demand as much of his strength and
intelligence. The victory in a game gratifies the child as a real
victory in battle delights the conqueror. Besides, most games are
imitations of the various occupations of adult life and cause the
child to show a decided inclination for some particular branch.
Plato, as well as other philosophers, recognized this fact. He
claimed that a boy, in order to be skilled in a special line of work,
should be trained to that work from childhood, and that his first
training should be by means of his games. Such preliminary instruction
should be followed by that based on theory and science.
Experience has often corroborated this theory of Plato, and Hellenic
life itself furnishes the best illustration of it. According to
the legend, Achilles, attired in the garb of a girl among the
daughters of the king, betrayed himself to the keen eye of Odysseus,
by handling the weapons, placed by the latter among the ornaments
which he offered for sale. Strepsiades, hard pressed by his
creditors, says that his son’s extreme fondness for horses and
chariots has ruined him, and continuing, he relates with pride how
as a mere child his son had made tiny leather carts, moulded
houses and ships, and carved frogs from pomegranate rind. (Aristophanes,
<i>Nub.</i> 877.) Cato the Younger also, says <a name="TN050_1" id="TN050_1"></a>Plutarch,
gave strong indications of his character by the games he played. The
youthful Nero amused himself daily by playing with ivory four-horse
chariots, thus indicating his future passion for chariot-racing in the
circus. The distinguished men of antiquity, when at home, often entered
heartily into the children’s games. The famous general, Agesilaos, is
represented as riding the hobby-horse with his little boys. Alkibiades
was surprised to see Sokrates doing the same thing while at play with
young Lamprokles. The Romans, a more serious people than the Greeks,
often sought recreation in ball-playing. Cato the Elder, and also
Scævola, are mentioned as expert ball players.</p>

<p class="tp">The Hellenes were thus well aware that uninterrupted employment
was detrimental to both physical and mental life. This idea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span>
was most beautifully expressed by Pythagoras in his hygiene of
body and soul. Therefore, in connection with the gymnastic system
of the Hellenes, were developed many gymnastic games which
did not require any special apparatus and which were not intended
for tests of superior strength, but merely to furnish pleasant and
suitable physical exercise.</p>

<p class="tp">A game called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="ostrakou peristrophê">ὀστράκου περιστροφή</span>
was often played. The boys arranged themselves in two divisions on
either side of a line. One of them then held up a piece of broken
crockery, or an oyster shell, one side of which was blackened with
tar. One division chose the black side, the other the white. A boy then
threw the fragment, with the words, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="nyx, hêmera">νύξ, ἡμέρα</span>.
The advantage belonged to that side whose color appeared uppermost after
the throw; this division then pursued the other; those who were captured
were called donkeys and were debarred from further participation
in the game.</p>

<p class="tp">The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="epostrakismos">ἐποστρακισμός</span>
(<i>Pollux</i> ix, 119), a more informal game, was played by boys on the
beach, or on the shore of a pond. The sport consisted in “skipping”
smooth, flat pebbles or shells over the surface of the water. The boy
who “skipped” his pebble to the greatest distance, or, perhaps, made it
cut the water the greatest number of times, was victor. This pastime,
known as “Ducks and Drakes,” is still in favor with boys.</p>

<p class="tp">There were two games for testing bodily strength, the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="dielkystinda">διελκυστίνδα</span>
and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="skaperda">σκαπέρδα</span>. In the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="dielkystinda">διελκυστίνδα</span> a party of
children separated into two divisions, each of which faced the other
in a row, so as to give every member an opponent. Probably a line of
some kind lay between the two divisions, and the game consisted in each
boy’s striving to pull his opponent across it by means of a rope. The
victory was decided when all members of one side had been forced to the
other.</p>

<p class="tp">The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="skaperda">σκαπέρδα</span> was
a game in which a rope was passed through a hole made in a tree-trunk or
rough pillar, at some distance from the ground. Two contestants then
took their places on opposite sides of the pillar, with their backs
to each other and each holding an end of the rope. If one of them could
succeed in lifting the other from the ground he was declared victor, but
so difficult was the feat that the phrase
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="skaperdan helkein">σκαπέρδαν <a name="TN051_1" id="TN051_1"></a>ἕλκειν</span>
came in time to be a proverbial expression applicable to very difficult
tasks. This sport was one of the amusements at the Attic Dionysia.</p>

<p class="tp">“Blind man’s buff” was played with slight variations under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span>
name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="chalkê myia">χαλκῆ μυῖα</span>, or “brazen fly,”
very prettily described by <i>Pollux</i> ix, 122.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="hê de chalkê myia, tainia tô ophthalmô perisphinxantes henos paidos, ho men peristrephetai kêryttôn: chalkên myian thêrasô: hoi de apokrinamenoi, thêraseis all’ ou lêpsei, skytesi biblinois paiousin auton, heôs tinos autôn lêpsetai">

αὐτόν, <a name="TN052_3" id="TN052_3"></a>ἕως τινὸς αὐτῶν λήψεται</span>.
One child was blindfolded and was obliged to capture one of the rest.
With outstretched arms he groped about, repeating the words
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="chalkên myian thrassô">χαλκῆν μυῖαν θράσσω</span>,
“I will hunt a brazen fly.” The others responded
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="thrasseis all’ ou lêpsei">θράσσεις ἀλλ’ οὐ λήψει</span>,
“you will hunt, but you will not catch,” and at the same time struck
him more or less lightly with whips or threads of papyrus. When one of
them was caught, he was blindfolded in place of the other, and the game
repeated.</p>

<p class="tp">A game called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="chytrinda">χυτρίνδα</span>
(<i>Pollux</i> ix, 110-113) demanded great dexterity on the part
of the player. One child sat in the middle and was called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="chytra">χύτρα</span>. The others ran round
him, pinching or striking him until by a quick movement he managed
to catch one of them, who was obliged to take his place and be the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="chytra">χύτρα</span> in turn. Sometimes the
child ran about in a circle, carrying on his head a jar which he
held with his left hand. His companions would strike him while asking him
the question, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="tis tên chytran?">τίς τὴν χύτραν;</span>
(who has the jar?), to which he answered, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="egô, Midas">ἐγὼ, Μίδας</span>
(I, Midas). If he touched one of the children with his foot, that
child had to take his place.</p>

<p class="tp">The term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="chyndalismos">χυνδαλισμός</span>
(<i>Pollux</i> ix, 120) was applied to a juvenile play, which somewhat
resembled our peg-top. The game consisted in flinging short, pointed
poles into the earth, in the following manner. The first child holds
his pole, directed downward, and then throws it so as to leave it
standing upright in the ground. The second child then tries to throw
his pole in such a way as to upset the first one and leave his own
standing in its place. The former player then tries his skill, and so
on. The arm and eye are especially trained in this game, which is still
played in some countries, generally in the spring when the ground is
soft.</p>

<p class="tp">A game especially suited to develop attention was the following.
The players formed a ring: One of them was provided with a
cord which he tried to place beside another child without being
detected in the act. If he succeeded in doing this, the one beside
whom the cord was found had to run round the ring amid the
blows of his playfellows; if, on the other hand, he had noticed the
other when putting the cord there, that one would have been
obliged to run round the ring himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p class="tp">A game resembling the modern jack-stones, in which five pebbles
were flung from the back of the hand and caught in the palm
in falling, was played under the name of
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="pentalithos">πεντάλιθος</span>. This game
was much in favor with Hellenic women, as well as with children,
and was said to be the favorite amusement of the famous beauty,
Phryne of Athens.</p>

<p class="tp">The game of king (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="basilinda">βασιλίνδα</span>)
consisted of feats, done by one child at the bidding of another,
as a soldier would obey a king. Who should be king and who soldier
was decided by lot.</p>

<p class="tp">A favorite pastime with children was the game called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="artiasmos">ἀρτιασμός</span> or
“Odd and Even” (<i>Pollux</i> ix, 101), in which they guessed
whether the number of objects one held concealed in his hand
was odd or even. Dice, nuts, coins, etc., were used for this purpose.
The amount won or lost was either the articles themselves
or a sum of money staked upon the guess. Horace also in the
Satires alludes to this game under the name <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludere par impar</span></i>
(<i>Satires</i> 2, 3; 248). Still another game of guessing was
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="kollabismos">κολλαβισμός</span>,
in which a child, with closed eyes, guessed who had given
him a box on the ears, and also which hand he had used in striking
him.</p>

<p class="tp">Greek children often played at the game called “hunt the slipper”
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="schoinophilinda">σχοινοφιλίνδα</span>), a
piece of rope being used instead of the slipper. The modern “hide and seek”
was the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="apodidraskinda">ἀποδιδρασκίνδα</span>.
“Kiss in the ring” (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="kynêtinda">κυνητίνδα</span>)
is another ancient game of which, however, we possess no correct details.
“Ride a cock horse”
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="kalamou peribênai">κάλαμου <a name="TN053_1" id="TN053_1"></a>περιβῆναι</span>)
was also an amusement of great antiquity, and was very popular both in
Greece and in Rome. Horace in the Satires (2, 3: 248) refers to this
sport in the following words: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">equitare in arundine
longa</span></i>.</p>

<p class="tp">The Greek and Roman children played several games
of skill with nuts, which resembled very closely our modern game
of marbles. Nuts played so important a part in childish sports
that <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuces relinquere</span></i> became a proverbial
expression for “putting away childish things.” The nuts were
pitched into a circle drawn on the ground called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="ômilla"><a name="TN053_2" id="TN053_2"></a>ὤμιλλα</span>
(<i>Pollux</i> ix, 102-3) or into a hole <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="bothros">βόθρος</span>
dug in the ground. Those that fell outside the circle were forfeited.
The name delta was given to a certain game with nuts in which a triangle
was chalked on the ground, and marked across with lines or bars running
parallel to the base. The player then flipped nuts into the triangle,
winning as many nuts as he crossed bars, provided, of course, that
they did not roll outside the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span> triangle,
in which case they were forfeited. Therefore, the most skilful play
consisted in driving the nut exactly to the apex of the triangle.</p>

<p class="tp">The ball (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="sphaira">σφαῖρα</span>)
was not only a favorite toy among children, but it also played an
important part in the physical exercises of youths and adults. No
other gymnastic exercise was so popular among the Greeks and Romans of
different periods as the ball games, though regarded less as a game
than as an exercise for strengthening the muscles and cultivating grace
and symmetry of body.</p>

<p class="tp">They were a favorite pastime in the Heroic age of the Hellenes
as well as in later times when Greece was at the height of its
glory. The Romans of the old Republic, and even in the reign of
the emperors, also sought recreation in ball-playing. The continued
favor which ball-playing enjoyed is sufficient proof of its
benefit to the body. The earliest mention of ball-playing is found
in two passages of the Odyssey (vi, 100; viii, 370; compare <i>Athen.</i>
i, 15, c. Plutarch, <i>Alex.</i> c. 73). In the second passage, Homer
represents ball-tossing as an adjunct to the dance. The game was
accompanied by music and Odysseus was surprised at the marvelous
dexterity of the players.</p>

<p class="tp">“And now Alcinoüs called on Halius and Laodamas to dance
alone, for with them none could vie. So taking in their hands a
goodly purple ball, which skilful Polybius had made them, one,
bending backward, flung it toward the dusky clouds; the other,
leaping upward from the earth, easily caught the ball before his
feet touched ground again. Then after they had tried the ball
straight in the air, they danced upon the bounteous earth with
tossings to and fro. Other young men beat time for them, standing
round the ring, and a loud sound of stamping arose. Then to
Alcinoüs said royal Odysseus: ‘Mighty Alcinoüs, renowned of all,
you boasted that your dancers were the best, and now it is proved
true. I am amazed to see.’” (Palmer’s translation.) This choric
ball-playing was very popular at Sparta (<i>Athenaios</i> i, 246), and
long survived.</p>

<p class="tp">The beautiful princess, Nausicaä (<i>Od.</i> vi, 100), and her companions
accompanied their game by singing, and the women of
Corcyra at a later period are said to have followed this ancient
custom. (<i>Athen.</i> i. 24 <i>b</i>.) At Sparta and Sicyonia ball-playing
was also accompanied by music.</p>

<p class="tp">The Athenians were so fond of ball-playing that they bestowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span>
the right of citizenship on Aristonikos of Karystos and erected
pillars in his honor, because he was so skilled and graceful a
player. The Spartans held this game in as high estimation as did
the Athenians, and to them is attributed the invention of ball
games. Among the kings of Greece, Alexander is mentioned as
favoring ball-playing.</p>

<p class="tp">In one of his plays, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Plyntriai">Πλυντρίαι</span>,
which was received with great favor, Sophocles introduced <a name="TN055_1" id="TN055_1"></a>Nausicaä
at play with a ball. Only the Milesians, who were devoted to
agonistic contests, disdained ball-playing, as it did not tend
to increase athletic ability and was of no value in helping them
to win prizes in the public games. Balls are found carved on
ancient monuments and tombs, especially on those of physicians,
as ball-playing was a form of gymnastics, and gymnastics as a
foundation for dietetics was a part of medicine. A gymnasium was
not considered complete without having a special room, called the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="sphairistêrion">σφαιριστήριον</span>,
devoted to the games of ball. A special instructor
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="sphairistikos">σφαιριστικός</span>) who
had made a scientific study of the games was appointed to superintend
this exercise, for it required much skill and practice for one to
become an expert in this branch of gymnastics.</p>

<p class="tp">The Romans were especially fond of ball-playing and considered
it a pleasant pastime for men rather than for boys. Cato the
Elder enjoyed a game of ball on the Field of Mars on the same
day that he <a name="TN055_2" id="TN055_2"></a>received the
refusal of the consulate (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oratio pro Archia
Poeta</span></i> <i>c.</i> 6, §6). Cicero, however, in a public speech, decried
ball-playing along with banquets and games of dice. The emperor,
Augustus, enjoyed a game of ball. Pliny, the younger,
relates that the aged Spurinna wrestled with old age by indulging
in ball-playing. At the time of the emperors a game at ball was
the most common exercise practised immediately before bathing in
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="sphairistêrion">σφαιριστήριον</span>
(ball-court) connected with the bath.</p>

<p class="tp">The Hellenes practised this exercise entirely naked or in light
undress. The Romans, on the other hand, never disrobed during
the game, except in the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="sphairistêrion">σφαιριστήριον</span>
and probably not always even there.</p>

<p class="tp">There were many different ways of playing at ball. Definite
descriptions of some have been handed down to us, but of others
we know simply by name. Pollux, Hesychios, Photios and Eustathios
consider the game called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="ourania">οὐρανία</span>
to be identical with that practised by the Phæacians, as in this,
according to Homer’s description, the body was bent backward and the ball was thrown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
high up into the air. The players then tried to catch the ball
before it touched the ground.</p>

<p class="tp">The game called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="episkyros">ἐπίσκυρος</span>
(<i>Pollux</i> ix, 104) at first peculiar to Sparta, was very popular
and took its name from the line <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="skyros">σκῦρος</span>
which separated the two divisions. On either side of this line and
parallel with it were drawn two base lines (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="grammai katopin">γραμμαὶ κατόπιν</span>)
beyond which the players could not go in catching the ball. The latter
was placed upon the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="skyros">σκῦρος</span>
(whence the name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="episkyros">ἐπίσκυρος</span>)
and the players started simultaneously from their respective base
lines. Whoever seized the ball first, threw it as far as he could
toward the enemies’ base line. The object, of course, was to force the
line of enemies back, by constantly returning the ball further and
further over their heads until they were driven over their own base
lines. In this case a swift runner must have had a great advantage over
the others, by securing the first throw.</p>

<p class="tp">A favorite game is described by the term
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="phaininda">φαινίνδα</span>). The peculiar
feature of this game was that the player who held the ball
appeared to aim it at a certain person, but really threw it in an
entirely different direction, thus disappointing one contestant and
surprising another. This game is said to have demanded the
utmost dexterity of a flexible, elastic body. It also allowed a
skilful player to display a fine carriage and much grace, as may be
seen in the description of Damoxenos by Athenaios (<i>Athen.</i> i, 15, 7).</p>

<p class="tp"><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Neanias tis esphairizen heis ... hos epei pot’ emblepseie tois kathêmenois, hê lambanôn tên sphairan, hê didous, hama pantes eboômen">

<p class="tp">The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="harpaston">ἁρπαστόν</span>
was the name of a certain game at ball much in favor with the Greeks
and also with the Romans of the time of the emperors. It required skill
in throwing, rapidity of movement, power of estimating distance, as
well as great care in catching the ball. The name of the game indicates
that each player tried to prevent the other from catching it. This game
is very frequently mentioned by Martialis, and according to him it was
also played by women.</p>

<p class="tp">The term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="aporrhaxis">ἀπόῤῥαξις</span>
was given to a certain ancient game at ball in which the ball was thrown
to the ground with great force and continually struck back with the hand,
as it rebounded. The number of times the ball was forced to the ground was
counted. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[Pg 59]</span>
victor was called king and could order the others about. The
loser was called donkey (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="onos"><a name="TN057_1" id="TN057_1"></a>ὄνος</span>).
In another form of the game the point was to keep tossing the ball up
into the air as long as possible with the open hand.</p>

<p class="tp">According to Oribasios, Antyllos at a later period reduced ball-playing
to a system, from a dietetic point of view. He made four
divisions according to the size and kind of ball used, and which he
described in detail. Galen also wrote exhaustively on the ball
games, which he considered of great importance on account of the
benefit which they imparted to the mental and physical powers.</p>

<p class="tp">In connection with these various ball games, they practised a
peculiar gymnastic exercise with the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="kôrykos">κώρυκος</span>,
a leathern sack that must have resembled the modern punching bag on which
pugilists try their fists. In form it resembled a ball, but in size
and weight far surpassed the largest and heaviest ball. The
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="kôrykos">κώρυκος</span> was filled with fig
seeds, meal or sand, and its size varied according to the age and
strength of the individual. It hung from the ceiling so as to reach
to about the middle of the player’s body. The bag was to be kept in
increasingly rapid motion by swinging it to and fro with the breast
and hands. The game is alluded to by Plautus (<i>Rud.</i> iii, 4, 16). This
sport cannot properly be styled a ball game, although it resembled one
in some respects. Athletes also engaged in this game, and the ancient
physicians regarded this exercise as very beneficial, because it not
only strengthened the muscles and nerves, but also tended to prevent
corpulency.</p>

<p class="tp">There are no records in classical literature to show that the
Greeks and Romans used the bat or racquet in any of their games.</p>

<p class="tp">At the early age of seven, the Spartan child was initiated into
disciplinary exercises of a severe character. At that age he came
under the charge of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="paidonomos">παιδονόμος</span>;
this official was, in conformance with the direction of Lykourgos,
one of the best citizens; he was expected to discipline the youth in
all the exercises that were so nicely adapted to develop the Spartan
citizen, and to teach him all the cunning and courage that would
afterwards be required in his service of the state.</p>

<p class="tp">In Attica a far different pedagogical scheme presents itself.
When children reached a proper age, the training of mothers and
nurses was succeeded by that of the school; hither they were
conducted each day by the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="paidagôgos">παιδαγωγός</span>,
a special slave whose duty it was not only to conduct the children to
and from school, but also to supervise their deportment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p class="p0a tp">In the Athenian school, gymnastics
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="gymnastikê">γυμναστική</span>) was not by any
means the sole course of training. The curriculum in fact included
three distinct courses:</p>

<p class="p0 p0a tl">(1) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="grammatikê">γραμματική</span>.</p>
<p class="p0 p0a tl">(2) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="mousikê">μουσική</span>.</p>
<p class="p0 p0a tl">(3) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="gymnastikê">γυμναστική</span>.</p>

<p class="p0">Under <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="grammatikê">γραμματική</span>
were included reading and writing, to which were added after the 4th
century <span class="allsmcap">B.&nbsp;C.</span> elementary geometry,
arithmetic and drawing.</p>

<p class="tp">When the child was able to read and write with facility, he
entered on the course called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="mousikê">μουσική</span>,
which embraced the study of poetry and music. Passages from Homer,
Hesiod, Theognis, Phokylides, and Solon, and from many lyric poets,
were read and committed to memory. Xenophon mentions in his Symposium
(<i>Symp.</i> iii, 5) a certain Nikeratos who had committed to memory the
whole of both the Iliad and the Odyssey. The boys were also taught to
chant the poems they had learned to the accompaniment of the lyre. Much
stress was laid on the moral effects of music.</p>

<p class="tp">But from no system of Greek education was
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="gymnastikê">γυμναστική</span>, the
careful and systematic development of the young body excluded.
Nor did this training cease in mature years; when young men left
the palæstra, they found awaiting them the gymnasium,&mdash;an institution
that was adapted to social as well as athletic purposes.</p>

<p class="tp">Nor did any Greek philosopher, as might, perhaps, be expected,
ever dream of dropping <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="gymnastikê">γυμναστική</span>
from his ideal scheme. In the Laws of Plato there is a detailed
discussion of the education of children, and the plan is therein
advocated of restricting the education of boys to gymnastics until
their tenth year; the regular study of letters was not to begin until
after the body had been made sound. Aristotle also maintained that
gymnastic training should precede as well as accompany that of the
mind.</p>

<p class="tp">Enough has been said to show that the Hellenic ideal of manhood
was not the mere scholar and subtle thinker, but the naked
athlete with firm flesh and swelling muscle. It may be asserted
that the mass of their young men reached during the best age of
Greek history a stage of physical perfection which has never been
attained in any other age or country. This is attested by thousands
of statues of victorious athletes, not only in Olympia but
throughout Greece. Although the Greeks had no cricket or football
they had on the other hand a far greater variety of games
than we have, and this variety made for the symmetrical development<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[Pg 61]</span>
of the body. The athletic sports of Greece remained great
and respected until excessive training and extreme specialization
brought ruin to them; that is, when a boxer devoted all his time
to boxing, and a wrestler to wrestling at the expense of a harmonious
development of the body. The influence of the old Greek
games upon sculpture, painting and poetry, as well as upon athletics,
will continue to keep alive for centuries to come the ideal
of a sound body for a sound mind.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
